## Everything is Connected: Ambient Sound in 'Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora'

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/everything-is-connected-ambient-sound-in-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/899744

作者：David Osternacher  (Lead Audio Designer, Massive Entertainment - A Ubisoft Studio)、Alex Riviere  (Audio Director, Massive Entertainment - A Ubisoft Studio)

Creating the sound for a game in the Avatar universe presented the audio team at Ubisoft Massive with a unique opportunity. Contrary to most AAA games, the star of the show is the world in which the game is set, Pandora. Audiences can finally come a huge step closer to living their fantasy of visiting the incredible place they've seen on the cinema screen. 


To make this experience believable, Pandora needs to have unprecedented fidelity, and feel like everything is connected. Every part of the world needs to have a sound, and every sound needs to have a logical link to the rest of the game. The world needs to react to the player constantly, whether they interact with it actively, or passively. 


This presentation outlines the creative strategies devised to achieve these goals, how to create the enormous amount of content needed to fulfill this vision, as well as the technology that had to be built in order to realize the team's intentions.

在《阿凡达》宇宙中为游戏创造音效为育碧大型游戏工作室的音频团队提供了独特的机会。与大多数AAA游戏不同的是，这款游戏的明星是所设定的世界潘多拉。观众终于可以更接近地体验他们在电影屏幕上看到的令人惊叹的地方，实现了他们的访问幻想。 

为了使这种体验更具置信度，潘多拉需要具有前所未有的细腻度，并且感觉一切都是相互关联的。世界的每个部分都需要有声音，每个声音都需要与游戏的其余部分有逻辑联系。这个世界需要不断地对玩家做出反应，无论他们是积极地与之互动，还是被动地经过。

本文概述了为实现这些目标而制定的创意策略，如何创建巨量所需内容以实现这一愿景，以及为实现团队意图而必须构建的技术。

## Finding Space For Sound: Acoustics in 'Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora'

作者：Robert Bantin  (Snowdrop Audio Architect, Massive Entertainment)

It’s been 5 years since we showed how the Snowdrop Engine delivered high-fidelity environmental acoustic effects for "Tom Clancy's The Division 2". With "Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora" these technologies had to be adapted or re-designed to a planetary scale, while also maintaining their fidelity at a city scale. Not only was this achieved, but the quality bar was significantly raised to deliver ever more detailed acoustic effects such as: Physically accurate early and late reflections; and more elegant direct field estimation.

自从我们展示了Snowdrop引擎为《汤姆·克兰西之全境封锁2》提供高保真环境声学效果以来已经过去了5年。而在《阿凡达：潘多拉前夜》中，这些技术必须被调整或重新设计，以适应行星尺度，同时还要在城市尺度上保持其保真度。不仅仅实现了这一点，而且质量标准也得到了显著提高，以提供更加详细的声学效果，例如：物理上准确的早期和晚期反射；以及更加优雅的直接场估计。

## Haptics: A Playful Collaboration Between Audio and Design

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/haptics-a-playful-collaboration-between-audio-and-design/898952

作者：Kristian Rømer  (Senior Sound Designer, IO Interactive)

This session will center around the design of controller vibrations, how the knowledge and expertise of sound designers in collaboration with game design can bring experiences to a new level using audio driven haptics.

Playing games is an intense sensory experience. We are bombarded with audiovisual feedback to both inform players of gameplay significant events and to keep them engaged and immersed in the world. We found that using high fidelity haptics could allow us to both make the game feel more responsive and increase immersion. As with auditory feedback, good haptics shouldn't draw the players attention, they work on a subconscious level and should refrain from breaking the illusion of the experience. 

This talk explores design principles and strives to inspire how you can create audio driven haptics to support interactive experiences.

这个讨论会围绕着手柄震动设计展开，讨论声音设计师在与游戏设计师合作中如何运用知识和专业技能，利用声音驱动触觉技术将游戏体验提升到一个新水平。

玩游戏是一种强烈的感官体验。我们被音频和视觉反馈淹没，既可以告知玩家游戏中重要事件，也让他们沉浸在游戏世界中。我们发现使用高保真的触觉可以让游戏更具响应性，增加沉浸感。与听觉反馈一样，好的触觉不应该吸引玩家的注意力，它们在潜意识层面起作用，应避免破坏体验的幻觉。

这次讲座探讨了设计原则，并努力激发灵感，展示如何创建声音驱动的触觉以支持互动体验。

作者：Joshua Bell  (Senior Technical Audio Designer, Remedy Entertainment)

Alan Wake 2's profiling feature allows the player to delve into the minds and motivations of the game's characters, and access their thoughts and glimpses of past/future events. It exists inside the Mind Place, a 3D-space, immersive in-game user-interface, and hub to filter narrative elements and explore the story.


Navigating the wealth of content, the narrative importance, and the abstract essence of the Mind Place and Profiling module posed challenges for the team. However, it presented a great chance to enhance Alan Wake 2's narrative and collaborate closely with visual disciplines to craft a cohesive audio-visual experience.


We will go through the audio design for the "Profiling" feature, exploring how we concepted, overcame technical limitations, gave ourselves a framework to execute the large amount of content needed, and utilised an "audio-driven audio" and audio-driven visuals approach to craft a balanced and coherent experience.

《艾伦·韦克2》的画像功能允许玩家深入游戏角色的思想和动机，访问他们的想法以及过去/未来事件的片段。它存在于“心智空间”内，这是一个三维空间、沉浸式的游戏用户界面，也是筛选叙事元素和探索故事的中心枢纽。

在导航内容的丰富性、心智空间和画像模块的叙事重要性以及抽象本质方面，团队面临了挑战。然而，这为提升《艾伦·韦克2》的叙事提供了一个绝佳机会，并与视觉学科紧密合作，打造一个连贯的视听体验。

我们将介绍“画像”功能的音频设计，探讨我们如何构思、克服技术限制，为执行所需的大量内容建立框架，并利用“音频驱动的音频”和音频驱动的视觉方法，打造一个平衡且连贯的体验。

## Rapid Music Production in Live Service Games

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/rapid-music-production-in-live-service-games/899663

作者：Maclaine Diemer  (Composer, First Name Maclaine, LLC)

Standalone games commonly allow composers an extended timeline to plan and execute a score, often taking years to refine the music alongside the development team. However, ongoing games, such as live service games with regular DLC, or an MMO with seasonal content and expansions, have very different musical needs. While there may be less total music per release, that often means there is less time to produce it. In this session, Maclaine breaks down his experience on the latest Guild Wars 2 expansion, Secrets of the Obscure, detailing the process and challenges of crafting a full-scale live orchestral score in just four months.

单机游戏通常允许音乐作曲家有更长的时间线来规划和执行配乐，通常需要数年的时间来与开发团队一起打磨音乐。然而，持续更新的游戏，比如定期推出 DLC 的在线服务游戏，或者带有季节性内容和扩展包的 MMO，具有非常不同的音乐需求。尽管每次发布的音乐可能会减少一些，但这通常意味着需要更少的时间来制作。在这个研讨会中，Maclaine 分享了他在最新的《激战2：幽测之密》扩展包上的经验，详细介绍了在仅仅四个月内打造完整的现场管弦乐谱的过程和挑战。

When starting a game audio career, it's very common to receive a barrage of well-meaning advice, both directly from those working in the industry and through various articles and online sources.

In this talk, sound designer Jamie Lee (A Shell in the Pit), senior audio programmer David Su (Brass Lion Entertainment), and composer/music implementer Megan Carnes (independent) share questions attendees can ask themselves when deciding whether to listen to a piece of advice. They also reveal how sometimes going against conventional wisdom helped them to build careers that they truly love.

作者：Alexander Radkevich  (Expert Localization Project Manager, CD Projekt Red)

Its always been the studio's goal to make Cyberpunk 2077 feel as if it was developed specifically for the audience in each of the territories CD PROJEKT RED brought the game to. With Phantom Liberty, REDs aimed to expand on this area even further — broadening the range of available languages and improving the tools that they have previously worked with. Alexander Radkevich will cover the demands of supporting the base game and working on the expansion in parallel, optimizing workflows to minimize the costs without giving up on the quality of the game, working with voice-over talents, and delivering tools that helped make the cooperation with external vendors smoother.

这家工作室一直以来的目标就是要使《赛博朋克2077》在CD PROJEKT RED推向的每个地区的受众中感觉就像是专门为他们开发的游戏。而对于《幻影自由》（Phantom Liberty），REDs则旨在进一步拓展这一领域 — 拓宽可提供的语言范围，并改进他们之前使用过的工具。Alexander Radkevich 将会满足支持基础游戏和同时开发扩展内容的需求，优化工作流程以降低成本但不牺牲游戏质量，与配音演员合作，并提供帮助使与外部供应商合作更加顺畅的工具。
