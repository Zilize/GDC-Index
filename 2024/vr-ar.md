3lb Games set out to create a multiplayer mixed reality game where players could pick up the game quickly with limited gameplay instruction. Don't think. Just do.


At the onset of the development for Grokit the team set forth a design philosophy for keeping the audience immersed while reducing the cognitive load of learning mechanics through natural hand gestures via hand tracking. Mixed reality and spatial interaction are key to gaining mass adoption because users are more at ease when they can see and interact with the real world. Headset manufacturers are now providing the cutting edge technology to make this a reality.


This postmortem gives a broad view of the development of Grokit and dives deeper into the technical challenges of multiplayer, spatial interactions, and scene understanding.

3lb Games旨在创建一款多人混合现实游戏，玩家能够在有限的游戏说明下迅速上手。别想太多，只管动手做。

在着手开发《Grokit》之初，团队制定了一个设计理念，即让受众沉浸其中同时通过手部追踪的自然手势减少学习游戏机制的认知负荷。混合现实和空间交互是获得大规模接受的关键，因为用户在能看到并与真实世界交互时更加放松。头戴式设备制造商现在提供最尖端技术，使这成为现实。

这篇事后总结为您提供了《Grokit》的开发整体情况，并深入探讨了多人游戏、空间交互和场景理解的技术挑战。

作者：Sarah Huth  (Director of Gameplay Engineering, Jadu AR)

Ask any gameplay programmer and most will agree that multiplayer games are the most difficult to develop. So why not build a multiplayer game that adds the additional technical challenge of augmented reality? What could possibly go wrong? A lot, it turns out.


The combined challenges of networking a competitive fighting game, syncing game data across two real-world spaces, the performance limitations of mobile, all with no control over the player camera and environment create a recipe for game development chaos. This talk will dive into the solutions the Jadu team developed to overcome the chaos and ship a first-of-its-kind multiplayer augmented reality fighting game.

请问任何游戏玩法程序员，大多数人都会同意多人游戏是最难开发的。那么为什么不开发一个加入增强现实技术的多人游戏，增加额外的技术挑战呢？会出什么问题呢？事实证明，很多问题。


将网络功能整合到竞技格斗游戏中、在两个现实世界空间中同步游戏数据、移动设备性能的限制，再加上对玩家摄像头和环境没有控制权，这些组合构成了一场游戏开发混乱的源头。这次讲话将深入探讨 Jadu 团队开发的解决方案，以克服这种混乱，并发布首款多人增强现实格斗游戏。

作者：Zach Deocadiz  (Senior VR Designer, Wave)

The feeling of physical embodiment and the ability to find community internationally are powerful drivers in the influence of VR on its users. A subset of the wider VR player base have used these benefits of VR to explore their gender identity and expression inside of social VR spaces, utilizing VR to explore powerful forms of self actualization. While this is a niche user group, we can learn a lot about how they have used existing VR social systems to their benefit because their experiences are more amplified versions of the general impact of VR on the general population. In this talk, an experienced VR designer explores how we may be able to learn from these users and their specific needs in order to design better VR experiences.

在虚拟现实（VR）对其用户产生影响方面，身体存在感和能够在国际范围内找到社区的能力是强大的推动因素。更广泛的虚拟现实玩家群体中的一个子集已经利用了虚拟现实的这些好处，来探索其社交虚拟现实空间内的性别认同和表达，利用虚拟现实来探索强大的自我实现形式。虽然这是一个小众用户群体，但我们可以从中学到很多东西，因为他们使用现有的虚拟现实社交系统的方式会更加凸显虚拟现实对一般大众产生的影响。在这次讲话中，一位经验丰富的虚拟现实设计师探讨了如何从这些用户及其特定需求中学习，以便设计更好的虚拟现实体验。
