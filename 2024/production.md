The industry has come a long way since testing games in the late 1990's and early 2000's. Come hear two experienced testers with over 40 years of combined experience, both working internally and externally with game studios, talk about the fun, often creative, and "wild-west" approach to testing, mistakes we made, lessons we've learned, and improvements we've brought over the years…as well as some lost arts focused on data that we continue to use to this day.

游戏测试行业自1990年代末至2000年代初以来已经取得了长足的发展。请来听听两位经验丰富的测试人员，他们拥有超过40年的综合经验，分别在游戏工作室内部和外部工作，谈论有趣的、经常富有创意的以及像“西部荒野”一样的测试方法，我们所犯的错误，我们所学到的教训，多年来我们带来的改进……以及一些关注数据的已失传的艺术，至今仍在使用。

## A Ticket to Redemption: How CD PROJEKT RED Utilized Technical Support Data and Insights to Improve 'Cyberpunk 2077'

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/a-ticket-to-redemption-how-cd-projekt-red-utilized-technical-support-data-and-insights-to-improve-cyberpunk-2077/899812

作者：Karolina Niewęgłowska  (Associate Director of Player Experience and Safety, CD PROJEKT RED)

After 'Cyberpunk 2077's' release, the whole CD PROJEKT RED studio focused on both improving the game and its own way of working. CDPR's Technical Support team (now Player Experience & Safety), which is an example of a team that works between dev and publishing with strong connections to both, actively participated in the 'Cyberpunk 2077' fixing and improvement process. An example of the journey of a 'Cyberpunk 2077' bug reported to support shows how different perspectives are used throughout the process of improving a game. The speaker argues that using all those perspectives results in more relevant actions on the part of the studio, which wouldn't be possible without teams from the whole dev-publishing spectrum working together. Furthermore, CDPR taking the direction of greater togetherness and closer internal cooperation after 'Cyberpunk 2077's' release is discussed.

在《赛博朋克2077》发布后，整个CD PROJEKT RED工作室都专注于改善游戏以及优化自身工作方式。CDPR的技术支持团队（现在称为玩家体验与安全团队），作为一个在开发和发行之间工作并与两者都有紧密联系的团队，积极参与了《赛博朋克2077》的修复和改进过程。一则关于《赛博朋克2077》的支持团队报告的bug解决过程展示了在改进游戏过程中如何运用不同的观点。发言者认为，利用所有这些观点会导致工作室采取更相关的行动，而这种情况在整个开发-发行领域的团队不共事合作的情况下是不可能实现的。此外，在《赛博朋克2077》发布后，CDPR采取更团结和内部合作更紧密的方向的情况也在讨论之中。

作者：Josh Harrison  (Director of Marketing, Velan Studios)

Every live service game will eventually shut down. Yes, even yours! Too often, headlines point the finger at developers, studio execs, or even toxic players, when this is a very natural conclusion to every online game. It's possible to teach players, investors, and fellow developers that a game's sunset is part of its lifecycle, so everyone feels better when it's time to pull the plug.'Knockout City' was launched in May 2021 and shut down in June 2023. The team at Velan Studios decided to take a different approach to their title's sunset, celebrating its successes at the end by going out with a bang, instead of brushing an ailing game under the rug.This session uses 'Knockout City' as a framework for how to sunset a game on a high note, and how to turn an unsustainable title into an opportunity for building brand loyalty, player goodwill, and positive press.

每款在线服务游戏最终都将会关闭。是的，就连你的游戏也不例外！太多时候，新闻标题把矛头指向开发者、工作室高管，甚至有毒的玩家，然而对于每款在线游戏来说，这是一个非常自然的结局。我们可以教育玩家、投资者和其他开发者，一个游戏的终止是其生命周期的一部分，这样在时候到来时大家都会感到好受一些。《击人城市》于2021年5月推出，于2023年6月关闭。Velan Studios团队决定采取一种不同的方式来庆祝他们作品的终止，通过一个高调的结束来庆祝其成功，而不是让一款不被看好的游戏黯然消失于公众视野。本次主题以《击人城市》作为一个框架，讲述如何在游戏的高潮中结束，并如何将一个不可持续的作品转变为建立品牌忠诚度、玩家好感和积极报道的机会。

作者：Xalavier Nelson Jr.  (Studio Head, Strange Scaffold)

El Paso, Elsewhere is a throwback third-person shooter that was praised as a "long-lost Remedy game"- all while excluding the most prominent feature of its primary inspiration. Unlike Max Payne, none of your enemies wield guns, making El Paso, Elsewhere a bullet time game... without opposing bullets. In this talk, creative director and Strange Scaffold studio head Xalavier Nelson Jr. walks fellow developers through the decisions and pivot points that allowed El Paso, Elsewhere to echo some of the most beloved titles in games history without being caught in their shadow.

《埃尔帕索：其他地方》是一款被誉为“失落的Remedy游戏”的传统第三人称射击游戏，然而它却排除了主要灵感来源最显著的特征。与《最大佩恩》不同，你的敌人没有人持枪，使得《埃尔帕索：其他地方》成为了一款弹道时间游戏...却没有敌人的子弹在对抗。在这次演讲中，创意总监和Strange Scaffold工作室负责人Xalavier Nelson Jr.将引领其他开发者们理解那些决策和转折点，使《埃尔帕索：其他地方》得以模仿游戏史上一些最受喜爱的作品，而不至于被它们的阴影所束缚。

作者：Ted Peterson  (CEO, OnceLost Games)、Julian LeFay  (Technical Director, OnceLost Games)

Julian LeFay and Ted Peterson on the 30th anniversary of the first Elder Scrolls game, Arena, discuss its origin, development, and publication from their perspective as creative leads on design and programming. Bethesda Softworks had previously only had success with sports games and its Terminator franchise, but LeFay and Peterson believed they could create a role-playing game based on an original property, a risky proposition. They delve into how the concept had to change radically because of technical hurdles during the course of development, resulting in missing their deadline and a less-than-stellar release. As a flop became a cult hit, and a sequel was warranted, LeFay and Peterson reflect on lessons learned that led to the development of a series which has sold billions of units and received critical acclaim. They conclude on what has brought them together decades later to continue their creative partnership.

朱利安·勒菲和泰德·彼得森在第一款《上古卷轴》系列游戏《竞技场》30周年时讨论了游戏的起源、开发和发布，从他们作为设计和程序负责人的角度出发。Bethesda Softworks此前只在体育游戏和《终结者》系列上取得了成功，但勒菲和彼得森相信他们可以基于原创IP创建一款角色扮演游戏，这是一个冒险性的提议。他们深入探讨了由于开发过程中的技术障碍而导致概念不得不发生根本性变化的原因，最终导致了未能按时完成并发布了一款不那么成功的游戏。而这款失败作品后来却成为了文化现象，并促使了续作的诞生。勒菲和彼得森反思了从中学到的教训，这些教训促成了一个销售了数十亿份并受到广泛好评的系列游戏的发展。最终，他们总结了数十年后仍然将他们带在一起继续创作合作的原因。

## Design with Localization in Mind: Approaches to Translation Damage Control

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/design-with-localization-in-mind-approaches-to-translation-damage-control/898919

作者：Anton Mukhataev  (Game Designer, Nine Rocks Games)

Most people play video games in their native language when they have a choice. To make it possible, developers turn to translators along with localization and LQA services. But with their workloads at all-time highs and their salaries in an unfortunate race to the bottom, translators cannot be expected to reverse-engineer game designs and work around design issues while they are doing their job. Learn 3 approaches to fireproof your game before localization and make the lives of your team, translators, and LQA engineers easier, with a focus on building design vocabularies and writing translation notes that are actually useful, a smart approach to automatic formatting and consistency checks as well as eliminating localization red flags in designs before your game goes into full-blown production.

大多数人在有选择的情况下会选择用自己的母语玩视频游戏。为了实现这一可能，开发人员会寻求翻译人员以及本地化和LQA（Localization Quality Assurance，本地化质量保证）服务。但是由于翻译人员的工作负荷达到了空前的高度，而他们的薪资却不断下跌，不能指望他们在工作时反向设计游戏并解决设计问题。学习三种方法来在本地化之前使游戏免受影响，并让团队、翻译人员和LQA工程师的生活变得更轻松，重点是建立设计词汇和撰写实际有用的翻译注释，采用智能的自动格式设置和一致性检查的方法，以及在游戏进入全面生产之前消除设计中的本地化障碍。

作者：Jessica Damerst  (Release Manager, Unknown Worlds Entertainment)

What does it take to build and nurture a hybrid and/or remote working environment? What are the challenges of working and coordinating teams across the globe? How can we foster a sense of belonging and inclusion across cultures and timezones? What are the challenges to hiring for and leading a hybrid team? During the pandemic, teams switched to working together remotely. As employees return to work, many companies are consciously offering a hybrid work environment, allowing for on-site and remote work. With globalization leading to faster and more reliable access to internet, hybrid development environments are becoming more feasible with each passing year. Yet they present their own unique challenges. Engage with other industry professionals on the topic of hybrid working arrangements—including hiring, team leadership, office spaces, company events, IT solutions, and more. Challenge the status quo of working a 9-to-5 office job with this collaborative and innovative approach development.

作者：Indrani Ganguly  (Studio Head & Game Designer, Duronto Games)

Every year, games rooted in diverse cultures are finding international audiences. People are interested in meaningful representation and diversity in the games they're playing. However, the conversation revolves around the content of the games, and not the people creating these games or the cultures that are being drawn from. By working with international talent, studios can build richer experiences for their players, while closing the geographical gap between the Global South and the West. In this talk, we'll discuss the reasons to work with global game professionals: creating better, culturally diverse, and resonant games - and doing so equitably.

每年都有源自不同文化的游戏吸引着国际观众。人们对他们所玩游戏中的意义性表达和多样性很感兴趣。然而，讨论围绕着游戏的内容展开，而非创造这些游戏的人或被借鉴的文化。通过与国际人才合作，工作室可以为玩家打造更丰富的体验，同时缩小全球南方与西方之间的地理差距。在这次谈话中，我们将讨论与全球游戏专业人员合作的原因：创作更好、多元文化且引人共鸣的游戏，并且公平地做到这一点。

作者：Sebastian Long  (MD, Player Research)

The role of player feedback in game development can be divisive and complex. Some studios totally embrace players' engagement in design through early access, open development, routine user research, and community engagement. Other studios limit player feedback to post-launch, or perhaps eschew it completely.


How can teams use the 'voice of the player' rationally, effectively and deliberately?


Are there challenges you face that player feedback could overcome? Can you make a greater success of the feedback you already have?


How does the 'voice' of player data change through development?


These three roundtables present a valuable opportunity to surface your challenges, viewpoints and experience on the use of player feedback to inform game design. Learn from the experiences of fellow designers, researchers, data scientists, community and player champions, and take away new ideas and perspectives on the value of players' voice in design decision-making.

玩家反馈在游戏开发中的角色可以是具争议性且复杂的。一些工作室完全支持玩家在设计中的参与，通过提供早期访问、开放式开发、定期用户研究以及社区互动。另一些工作室可能将玩家反馈限制在游戏发布后，甚至完全避免接受反馈。

你面临的挑战是否可通过玩家反馈来克服？如何更好地利用你已经获得的反馈呢？
玩家数据的“声音”在开发过程中会发生怎样的变化？

这三个圆桌会议为你提供了一个宝贵的机会，让你就利用玩家反馈来指导游戏设计的挑战、观点和经验进行讨论。从其他设计师、研究人员、数据科学家、社区和玩家倡导者的经验中学习，获得关于玩家的声音在设计决策中的价值的新想法和视角。

When you ask game industry veterans what was the toughest moment in their careers, one answer is quite common: When I had to step up and become a manager. According to The Workforce Institute, 46% of middle managers are likely to quit this 2023 because of stress related issues. The first steps into the management journey are very treacherous, it's easy to become overwhelmed, or burn yourself out. But fear not, in this talk I want to share the secrets that kept me sane during this transition! I come from a management background and I've seen the best, the worst and everything in between. Now, after 7 years in the video game industry as an animator, I want you to join me in this little journey to healthy management. Being a manager can be something very rewarding, if done correctly!

作者：Cabel Sasser  (Co-Founder, Panic)

Imagine a company that has only ever made easily-downloadable computer software deciding to suddenly jump into an entirely new world of creation: hardware. A company that’s used to almost any problem being solved by hitting a breakpoint and entering a debugger, suddenly facing a universe of atoms, and physics, and far-away factories with lots (and lots) of uncontrollable variables, not to mention shipping companies.Ridiculous? Yes. (Ultimately) successful? Also yes!The journey of creating Playdate, our indie bright-yellow handheld video game system (and now, platform!) was fulfilling, but also challenging, but also really fulfilling. And if you some time to spare, I’d love to share with you a collection of stories about the ups, downs, and inside-outs of hardware development, some key learning moments we had along the way, and maybe even some thoughts about just, you know, running a business in general. Let’s have some fun!

想象一家只生产易于下载的计算机软件的公司，突然决定跳入一个全新的创作世界：硬件。一个习惯于几乎任何问题都能通过击中断点并进入调试器来解决的公司，突然面对一个由原子、物理和遥远的工厂以及无法控制的很多（非常多）变量组成的宇宙，更不用说运输公司了。荒谬？是的。最终成功？同样是！创造《Playdate》，我们那款明亮的黄色独立手持式视频游戏系统（现在还是一个平台！）的旅程是充满成就感的，但也充满挑战，同时也真正充实。如果你有一些空闲时间，我很乐意与你分享一系列关于硬件开发过程中坎坷、挑战和内外的故事，我们沿途学到的一些关键经验，甚至也许一些关于经营企业的思考。让我们玩得开心吧！

The "burnout of entire micro-generations of developers." According to 2020's GDC State of the Industry, "game development [is] an industry driven by young workers who tend to depart within a decade." Reasons for those departures typically range from culture to pay to abuse/exclusion, and more. The industry has yet to address, or in some cases, even acknowledge that the way we work may itself be the root of the problem. We can fix this. It's time to rethink the way games are made. In "The Way We Work – Embracing Human Sustainability in Game Development" micro-talks, we'll hear from industry leaders tackling these institutional problems as they lead, build, and run studios. We will share real-world examples and strategy on how to successfully build worker autonomy in the hybrid workplace. Attending leaders will learn how to shift to people-first solutions, develop long-term sustainability culture, and pursue practical solutions to hiring.

在2020年《游戏开发者大会行业现状报告》中提到了对整个微时代开发者的“耗竭”。据指出，“游戏开发[是]一个由年轻员工推动的产业，他们往往在十年内离开。” 这些离开的原因通常涵盖文化、薪酬、滥用/排斥等等方面。这个行业尚未解决，或者在某些情况下甚至未意识到工作方式本身可能是问题的根源。我们可以解决这个问题。现在是重新思考游戏制作方式的时候了。在“我们的工作方式 - 在游戏开发中拥抱人类可持续性”微型讲座中，我们将听取行业领袖在领导、建立和经营工作室时如何解决这些机构问题的见解。我们将分享成功在混合工作场所建立员工自主权的真实案例和策略。参与的领导者将学习如何转变为以人为本的解决方案，发展长期的可持续文化，并追求雇佣的实际解决方案。

作者：Tina Chan  (Sr. User Experience Researcher, Respawn Entertainment)

Live games often move quickly, and it is common for different features to have independent roadmaps and develop at different speeds. This system's flexibility enables teams to deliver quality content at meaningful times. By purposefully becoming embedded in this Agile process, user research teams could improve insight impact with timely deliveries and also gain influence among partners. This talk walks through examples of embedded workflows used by the user experience research team of Apex Legends, a free-to-play hero shooter game by Respawn Entertainment - and how it has unblocked development in timely & impactful ways. Examples include supporting a multiple features from pre-concept to polishing with just-in-time insight delivery, and triangulating or re-contextualizing findings of prior or partner research for new insights, and socializing research to facilitate design discussions.

实况游戏通常进行迅速推进，不同功能往往拥有独立的路线图并以不同速度发展。这种系统的灵活性使团队能够在有意义的时机交付高质量内容。通过有意识地融入敏捷过程，用户研究团队可以通过及时交付改善洞察力，并在合作伙伴中获得影响力。这次讨论将介绍《'Apex Legends'》中Respawn Entertainment的免费英雄射击游戏中用户体验研究团队使用的嵌入式工作流程示例，以及它如何及时而有影响力地解决了开发中的障碍。示例包括支持从前期概念到优化的多项功能，并通过及时提供洞察力、三角形调查或重新背景化以往或合作伙伴研究的发现，以及促进设计讨论的社交化研究。
