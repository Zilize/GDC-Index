作者：Michael V. Eppinette  (Sr. Concept Artist, NetEase Games)

Creatures are central to Game Design – they are our companions and our bosses, our friends and our enemies. They populate fantasy worlds with wonder, danger, and intrigue. In a market saturated with monsters of every shape and species, how can an artist design competitively original creatures that delight, terrify, and intrigue their audience? How do animals use illusion and motifs to impress, deceive, and surprise each other, and how can a designer implement these strategies to powerful narrative effect? Join former zookeeper and NetEase Sr. Creature Designer Michael V. Eppinette as he explores his journey to understanding these questions over the course of his time designing the Feral Predator for Prey (2022), and as he demonstrates techniques, strategies, and a practical philosophy for symbolism-driven design, inspired by the dramatic weirdness of the animal kingdom.

生物在游戏设计中占据着核心地位-它们是我们的伴侣和boss，我们的朋友和敌人。它们让幻想世界充满了奇迹、危险和神秘。在市场上充斥着各种形态和物种的怪物时，一位艺术家如何能够设计出具有竞争力的原创生物，让观众感到愉悦、恐惧和神秘呢？动物们如何运用幻象和主题来给彼此留下深刻印象、欺骗和惊讶，设计师又该如何将这些策略应用到强大的叙事效果中呢？加入前动物园管理员兼网易资深生物设计师迈克尔·V·埃皮内特(Michael V. Eppinette)的行列，跟随他探索设计《猎物》(2022)中凶猛猎食者(Feral Predator)的过程中理解这些问题的旅程，以及他展示的以象征为驱动的设计技巧、策略和实用理念，灵感来源于动物王国那戏剧性的怪异现象。

## Art Direction Summit: The Synergy of Architecture and Structural Engineering in Game Art and Design

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/art-direction-summit-the-synergy-of-architecture-and-structural-engineering-in-game-art-and-design/901271

作者：Joshua Haun  (Expert Environment Artist, Activision)

Synergy, or effectively "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts," is applied to how knowledge of architecture can lead to emergent environments in the virtual world of video games. Design methodologies employed by notable architects paired with structural design principles, are taught as patterns that can be utilized by artist and designers to create virtual worlds where the user feels completely catered to. Realism of space is often seen as the only benefit when following real world architectural design principles, and this talk expands this into patterns that help guide an artist or designer into arranging spaces that subconsciously speak to the end user. It is the combined effect of many conditions that influence the user, and that synergy can be tapped into with games just as well as the real world.

‘协同效应’，或者有效地说“整体大于部分之和”，被应用于建筑知识如何在视频游戏的虚拟世界中引导出新兴环境。著名建筑师采用的设计方法与结构设计原则被教授为模式，可以被艺术家和设计师利用来创建让用户完全满意的虚拟世界。当遵循真实世界的建筑设计原则时，空间的真实感通常被视为唯一的好处，而这段讨论将其扩展为帮助指导艺术家或设计师布置空间，潜意识地传达给最终用户的模式。影响用户的是许多条件的综合效果，这种协同效应可以在游戏中以及现实世界中得到利用。

## Classic Game Postmortem: 'Star Wars: TIE Fighter'

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/classic-game-postmortem-star-wars-tie-fighter/903257

作者：David  Wessman  (Lecturer, Breda University of Applied Sciences)

Following the success of Star Wars: X-Wing, there was Star Wars: TIE Fighter, the first Star Wars video game putting the player in service of the Empire. Released in 1994, the game was an even more successful worldwide hit, earning numerous “Game of the Year'' awards, including the Honored Developer Award at GDC for its finely-crafted, story-driven, mission-based gameplay. Led by renowned developers Lawrence Holland and Edward Kilham, it was also the sophomore effort of mission builders David Wessman and David Maxwell. With a more advanced engine and tools, the duo created the deeply immersive and challenging missions that expanded the Star Wars universe and put TIE Fighter on several “Best Game of All Time” lists.Thirty years later, David Wessman discusses how he and David Maxwell took the lessons learned in the making of X-Wing to craft a game that was both more accessible and had more expansive and varied gameplay as well as a richer narrative that was supplemented by the official strategy guide that they co-authored with Rusel DeMaria.

在《星球大战：X翼战机》取得成功之后，推出了《星球大战：TIE战斗机》，这是第一款让玩家为帝国效力的星球大战视频游戏。该游戏于1994年推出，取得了更大的全球成功，赢得了诸多“年度游戏”奖项，包括GDC颁发的荣誉开发者奖，以表彰其精心打磨、以故事为驱动、基于任务的游戏玩法。由知名开发者Lawrence Holland和Edward Kilham领导，这也是任务构建者David Wessman和David Maxwell的第二个努力。在拥有更先进引擎和工具的情况下，这对二人创作了沉浸式且富有挑战性的任务，拓展了星球大战宇宙，使得《TIE战斗机》被列入多个“史上最佳游戏”榜单。三十年后，David Wessman讨论了他和David Maxwell如何借鉴制作《X翼战机》时所学到的经验，打造了一款更易上手、玩法更广泛且多样化，配以更丰富叙事的游戏；官方攻略指南则由他们与Rusel DeMaria共同撰写，为游戏增色不少。

作者：Ted Peterson  (CEO, OnceLost Games)、Julian LeFay  (Technical Director, OnceLost Games)

Julian LeFay and Ted Peterson on the 30th anniversary of the first Elder Scrolls game, Arena, discuss its origin, development, and publication from their perspective as creative leads on design and programming. Bethesda Softworks had previously only had success with sports games and its Terminator franchise, but LeFay and Peterson believed they could create a role-playing game based on an original property, a risky proposition. They delve into how the concept had to change radically because of technical hurdles during the course of development, resulting in missing their deadline and a less-than-stellar release. As a flop became a cult hit, and a sequel was warranted, LeFay and Peterson reflect on lessons learned that led to the development of a series which has sold billions of units and received critical acclaim. They conclude on what has brought them together decades later to continue their creative partnership.

朱利安·勒菲和泰德·彼得森在第一款《上古卷轴》系列游戏《竞技场》30周年时讨论了游戏的起源、开发和发布，从他们作为设计和程序负责人的角度出发。Bethesda Softworks此前只在体育游戏和《终结者》系列上取得了成功，但勒菲和彼得森相信他们可以基于原创IP创建一款角色扮演游戏，这是一个冒险性的提议。他们深入探讨了由于开发过程中的技术障碍而导致概念不得不发生根本性变化的原因，最终导致了未能按时完成并发布了一款不那么成功的游戏。而这款失败作品后来却成为了文化现象，并促使了续作的诞生。勒菲和彼得森反思了从中学到的教训，这些教训促成了一个销售了数十亿份并受到广泛好评的系列游戏的发展。最终，他们总结了数十年后仍然将他们带在一起继续创作合作的原因。

作者：Jordan DeVries  (Lead UX/UI Designer, Respawn Entertainment)

STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor's lightsaber workbench mechanic is widely praised—both for its depth and ease-of-use—despite being deceptively complex, serving hundreds of colors and parts, and even brand-new-to-canon categories. This talk from the game's UI/UX Lead recounts the journey of the 10 different interface iterations it took, where to improve as a sequel, key trade-offs, and core findings, all backed by player research and testing.

《STAR WARS 绝地：幸存者光剑工作台机制》因其深度和易用性广受好评，尽管机制看似复杂，但却提供了数百种颜色和零件，甚至包括全新的世界观范畴。该游戏的UI/UX负责人在这次讲话中回顾了这一过程中经历的10次不同界面迭代，探讨了如何在续作中进行改进、主要权衡以及核心发现，所有这些都基于玩家研究和测试。

作者：David McClure  (Lead Game Designer, Crytek)

DEATHLOOP lets players create their own builds using Trinkets (socketable modifiers) and Weapon Perks (fixed modifiers). These items are designed to give players freedom and choice, and to allow for emergence. This is the story of how the team at Arkane Lyon created the feature together, and the steps they took as they tried to achieve these goals.In this session, David McClure, Lead Game Designer at Crytek, discusses key design decisions, and explains the reasoning behind specific choices. The biggest practical production problems are also covered, alongside their solutions, and ways to avoid difficulties when working on similar features. Finally, the outcome is discussed: Were the goals reached, and could the path have been made any easier?

《DEATHLOOP》让玩家使用特制物品（可镶嵌修饰物）和武器特性（固定修饰物）来打造自己的角色建模。这些物品旨在赋予玩家自由和选择的权利，并促使游戏玩法多样化。本节目将讲述阿尔坎·里昂工作室团队一同创造此功能的故事，以及他们在努力实现这些目标时所采取的步骤。在本次讨论中，由Crytek首席游戏设计师大卫·麦克卢尔介绍了主要设计决策，并解释了特定选择背后的理由。此外，还涵盖了最大的实际制作问题，以及它们的解决方案，以及在开发类似功能时避免困难的方法。最后，将讨论结果：目标是否实现，路径是否能更容易走通？

## Dark Patterns: Shining a Light on Unlawful Game Design

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/dark-patterns-shining-a-light-on-unlawful-game-design/900015

作者：Eric Weiss  (Attorney (Partner), Perkins Coie LLP)

The Federal Trade Commission is targeting game companies that use so-called "dark patterns." Hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake, and addressing otherwise avoidable litigation is expensive, time consuming, and distracting.Dark patterns are "tricks used in websites and apps that make customers do things that they didn't mean to, like buying or signing up for something." They include interfaces that confuse users, make it difficult to express actual preferences, or manipulate users into taking certain actions they otherwise would not. Understanding dark patterns is critical because game developers may not realize they are designing unlawful interfaces—and game companies can mitigate their litigation risk in part by ensuring that their procedures for obtaining purchasing consent include an affirmative and unambiguous act by the consumer and by providing a cancellation mechanism that is as easy to use as the method used to make the purchase.

美国联邦贸易委员会正在针对使用所谓的“暗模式”（dark patterns）的游戏公司。数亿美元的利益受到威胁，应对本可以避免的诉讼费用巨大、耗时且分散注意力。暗模式是指“网站和应用程序中使用的技巧，使顾客做出他们本不打算做的事情，比如购买或注册”。这些技巧包括混淆用户界面、使用户难以表达实际偏好或操纵用户采取他们本不会采取的某些行动。了解暗模式至关重要，因为游戏开发者可能没有意识到他们正在设计非法界面—游戏公司可以通过确保其获取购买同意的程序包括用户积极且明确的行为，并提供取消机制使其易于使用，从而在一定程度上降低他们的诉讼风险。

## Design at Record-Breaking Scale in 'Sky: Children of the Light'

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/design-at-record-breaking-scale-in-sky-children-of-the-light/898735

作者：Nicolas Oueijan  (Senior Technical Game Designer, thatgamecompany)

When bringing together over 10,000 players, the task of creating a coherent—let alone emotionally resonant—shared experience can seem impossible. What does it mean to assemble so many concurrent players, and how do developers design for them? At this scale, even the smallest decisions have colossal repercussions. To create a journey that everyone enjoys, not in spite of but rather thanks to, the presence of thousands beside them, everything from player mechanics to game visuals needs to be reshaped to harmonize when resonating en masse. These were the unprecedented challenges that thatgamecompany faced when creating the record-breaking AURORA concert in Sky: Children of the Light. This talk walks through the design process from conception to ship, highlighting major design challenges, solutions, and learnings that can inform similar large-scale projects.

当汇聚超过10,000名玩家时，创建一个连贯—更不用说是引人共鸣的—共享体验似乎是一项不可能完成的任务。组织这么多同时在线玩家意味着什么？开发者们又是如何为他们设计的呢？在这种规模下，即使是最微小的决定也会产生巨大的影响。为了创造一个每个人都能享受的旅程，而不是尽管有数千人在身边，也要多亏这些人的存在，从玩家机制到游戏视觉，一切都需要重新塑造，以便在大规模共振时保持和谐。这些就是thatgamecompany在开发创纪录的《天空：光的孩子》中AURORA音乐会时面临的前所未有的挑战。本讲座将从概念到发布的设计过程中，重点介绍主要的设计挑战、解决方案和经验教训，以帮助类似的大型项目。

## Design with Localization in Mind: Approaches to Translation Damage Control

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/design-with-localization-in-mind-approaches-to-translation-damage-control/898919

作者：Anton Mukhataev  (Game Designer, Nine Rocks Games)

Most people play video games in their native language when they have a choice. To make it possible, developers turn to translators along with localization and LQA services. But with their workloads at all-time highs and their salaries in an unfortunate race to the bottom, translators cannot be expected to reverse-engineer game designs and work around design issues while they are doing their job. Learn 3 approaches to fireproof your game before localization and make the lives of your team, translators, and LQA engineers easier, with a focus on building design vocabularies and writing translation notes that are actually useful, a smart approach to automatic formatting and consistency checks as well as eliminating localization red flags in designs before your game goes into full-blown production.

大多数人在有选择的情况下会选择用自己的母语玩视频游戏。为了实现这一可能，开发人员会寻求翻译人员以及本地化和LQA（Localization Quality Assurance，本地化质量保证）服务。但是由于翻译人员的工作负荷达到了空前的高度，而他们的薪资却不断下跌，不能指望他们在工作时反向设计游戏并解决设计问题。学习三种方法来在本地化之前使游戏免受影响，并让团队、翻译人员和LQA工程师的生活变得更轻松，重点是建立设计词汇和撰写实际有用的翻译注释，采用智能的自动格式设置和一致性检查的方法，以及在游戏进入全面生产之前消除设计中的本地化障碍。

作者：Paweł Sasko  (Associate Game Director, CD PROJEKT RED)

During 12 years in CD PROJEKT RED, Paweł has contributed to multiple games, including 3 expansions: Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine for The Witcher 3, and most recently, Phantom Liberty, for Cyberpunk 2077. The lecture contains lessons learned from designing these games – everything from choosing themes, designing plots, and expanding gameplay features in a way that creates a consistent whole with the base games.

在 CD PROJEKT RED 工作了 12 年的 Paweł 参与了多款游戏的开发，包括 3 个扩展包：'石之心' 和 '血与酒' (Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine) 为《巫师 3》 ('The Witcher 3')，最近还有《赛博朋克 2077》中的 '幻象自由' (Phantom Liberty)。这次演讲包含了从设计这些游戏中学到的经验教训 - 从选择主题、设计情节，到扩展游戏特性，以一种创造出与基础游戏一致整体的方式。

## Designing Active Time Lore for 'Final Fantasy XVI'

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/designing-active-time-lore-for-final-fantasy-xvi/898912

作者：Momoka Aono  (Game Designer, Square Enix Co., Ltd.)

For a story-driven game which has heavy and complex lore, players' understanding the in-game world leads to deeper immersion, but the in-game terminology and unique world rules sometimes make players feel that it's hard to grasp the background.

While fantasy games often use glossary and texts to introduce the in-game world's rules, what people's common sense is, or lots of characters and place names that difficult to remember, most players, except the ones who are interested in lore, rarely reads them.

In this session, we will demonstrate how UIs can help players better understand the story of the game through examples of the lore support system called "Active Time Lore", invented for FINAL FANTASY XVI.

Active Time Lore helps players with a selection of lore tips they need "at the moment" by responding to input a player's pausing during a cutscene or gameplay.

在一个故事驱动的游戏中，如果游戏设定有着丰富和复杂的传说，玩家对游戏世界的理解将促使更深度的沉浸，但游戏术语和独特的世界规则有时会让玩家感到难以掌握背景。

虽然幻想游戏经常使用术语表和文本来介绍游戏世界的规则，其中包括人们常识、或者很难记住的许多角色和地名，但除了那些对传说感兴趣的玩家，大多数玩家很少会去阅读它们。

在这个环节中，我们将通过“FINAL FANTASY XVI”中专为游戏打造的传说支持系统“动态传说时间”作为例子，演示UI如何帮助玩家更好地理解游戏故事。

“动态传说时间”通过在玩家在剧情或游戏中暂停时作出回应，为玩家提供他们当前“所需的”传说提示，从而帮助玩家更好地理解游戏的故事。

## Developing 'Hi-Fi RUSH' Backwards and Finding our Positive Gameplay Loop

作者：John Johanas  (Game Director, Tango Gameworks)

In this session, Game Director John Johanas shares how the initial concept for Hi-Fi RUSH came to be. From there, he provides in-depth details into the development team's early learnings on approaching this type of rhythm-action title. This required approaching their game design philosophy from a totally different angle than they've done previously, essentially working backwards from their desired result for Hi-Fi RUSH.John goes over specific examples of how the team gained these learnings through gameplay and how this approach affected other core elements of the game - specifically, how defining their mechanics with core pillars solidified a "positive feedback loop" for the user and lowered the barrier to entry to enjoy Hi-Fi RUSH. This session covers how Tango approached combining music and the action game genre, but this approach can be applied to any teams attempting to implement creative ideas outside of their comfort zone.

在这个交流环节中，游戏总监约翰·约翰纳斯分享了《Hi-Fi RUSH》最初概念的形成过程。他深入介绍了开发团队在开发这种节奏动作游戏时的早期经验教训。这要求他们从一个与之前完全不同的角度来考虑他们的游戏设计理念，基本上是通过从他们对《Hi-Fi RUSH》的期望结果开始逆向工作。约翰详细讲解团队是如何通过游戏玩法获得这些经验教训的，以及这种方法如何影响了游戏的其他核心要素 - 具体来说，如何通过将核心支柱定义为游戏机制，为用户建立了一个"正向反馈循环"，并降低了享受《Hi-Fi RUSH》的准入门槛。这个交流中介绍了唐果是如何将音乐和动作游戏类型相结合的，但这种方法可以应用于任何试图在其舒适区之外实现创意想法的团队。

## Empower Your Players: How to Level-Up Difficulty Modes into Accessibility

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/empower-your-players-how-to-level-up-difficulty-modes-into-accessibility/899194

作者：Steven Weitz  (Director of Professional Development, The AbleGamers Charity)

"Does X game need an easy mode?" This question, bandied about on social media any time a particularly challenging game is released, is often followed by the response, "What X game needs is to be more accessible!" Confusion results: after all, many games include as a key feature for accessibility, "A variety of difficulty modes." Aren't difficulty modes the same as accessibility options? This talk shows how accessibility in gameplay challenge is much more nuanced than traditional difficulty modes allow, and gives attendees both a better understanding of how to think about accessibility in challenge and some solutions for using difficulty modes as a starting point to create more accessible gameplay experiences.

“是否《X游戏》需要一个简单模式？”这个问题经常在社交媒体上讨论，特别是当一个特别具有挑战性的游戏发布时，通常会有人回应：“《X游戏》需要的是更易接近！” 混淆产生了：毕竟，许多游戏将“各种难度模式”作为一个重要的辅助功能。 难度模式难道不就等同于辅助选项吗？ 这个讲座展示了游戏挑战中的辅助性要远比传统难度模式所允许的更加微妙，并让参与者更好地理解如何考虑挑战中的辅助性，并提供了一些解决方案，从难度模式出发，以创建更加容易接近的游戏体验。

作者：Marc LeBlanc  (Senior R&D Software Engineer, Riot Games)

This intensive two-day workshop will explore the day-to-day craft of game design through hands-on activities, group discussion, analysis, and critique. Attendees will immerse themselves in the iterative process game design and discover design concepts that will help them think more clearly about their designs and make better games.Working in small groups, attendees will work on two design exercises each day. Each exercise will require the group to work iteratively to modify an existing game design to meet some new goal. An exercise might involve adding a new feature, accommodating a requirement, or fixing a design flaw. Attendees will learn how to apply the Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics (MDA) framework to their design process. The exercises will challenge attendees to analyze and identify the design principles at work in a game, and to think flexibly and creatively while working within design constraints. They will serve as a starting point for discussing how the framework applies to games in digital and non-digital media. Attendees will gain practical experience working with the MDA framework brainstorming, critical analysis, and discussion.

这个为期两天的密集研讨会将通过实践活动、小组讨论、分析和批评来探索游戏设计的日常工艺。参与者将沉浸在游戏设计的迭代过程中，发现设计概念，帮助他们更清晰地思考自己的设计并制作更好的游戏。参与者将分成小组，每天将进行两个设计练习。每个练习都要求小组进行迭代工作，修改现有游戏设计以达到某个新目标。一个练习可能涉及添加新功能、满足需求或修复设计缺陷。参与者将学习如何将“机械-动态-美学”（MDA）框架应用于他们的设计过程。这些练习将挑战参与者分析和识别游戏中正在发挥作用的设计原则，并在设计约束条件下灵活和富于创造性地思考。它们将作为讨论该框架如何适用于数字和非数字媒体游戏的起点。参与者将通过使用MDA框架进行头脑风暴、批判性分析和讨论来获得实际经验。

## Improving Your Tool UX Design by Removing the Faults of "Sensible Defaults"

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/improving-your-tool-ux-design-by-removing-the-faults-of-sensible-defaults/899901

作者：Robin-Yann Storm  (Tool UX & Workflow Designer, Independent)

When we make game development tools it is very easy to pick what we think is a 'sensible default', and have all users deal with it. We think those defaults makes sense, and work for most users. However, even a cursory look at DCCs such as Unity, Unreal, 3dsMax, Maya, and Blender shows us that this is wrong. Unity, Max, and Maya have the hierarchy on the left side of the screen, while Unreal and Blender have the hierarchy on the right side of the screen. The same differences can be found between all of them when it comes to toolbars, the 3D view, the property panel, and the asset browser. There is no 'sensible default' for any of those panels in the UI, yet we often hear they 'should' be on the left or 'should' be on the right.

What do we have to unlearn, to improve the UX of our tools?

在开发游戏工具时，很容易选择我们认为是‘合理默认值’，让所有用户去适应。我们认为这些默认设置是合理的，并适用于大多数用户。然而，对于诸如Unity、Unreal、3dsMax、Maya和Blender等DCC软件的简单查看就告诉我们这是错误的。Unity、Max和Maya在屏幕左侧拥有层次结构，而Unreal和Blender则在屏幕右侧拥有层次结构。当涉及到工具栏、3D视图、属性面板和资源浏览器时，它们之间存在相同的差异。在界面中，这些面板没有任何‘合理默认值’，但我们经常听到它们‘应该’在左侧或者‘应该’在右侧。

为了改进我们工具的用户体验，我们需要忘掉什么？

## It Takes a Village: Cultivating Social Coziness in 'Palia'

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/it-takes-a-village-cultivating-social-coziness-in-palia/899488

作者：Eileen Shiue  (Design Director, Singularity6)

Until recently, games that feel cozy, and games that feel deeply social, have felt mutually exclusive. Competitive games can tell inspiring stories of friendship and triumph, yet are generally guaranteed to have many examples of player frustration escalating into disruptive behavior, while many cozy games have either focused on single player experiences, or limited multiplayer experiences which range between one-off interactions with strangers that don't lead to creating connections and deeper persistent experiences with existing friends. With Palia, the team aimed to break into the unsolved "Cozy MMO" space, leveraging the Community Sim genre that gives a clear foundation and demographic that already recognizes the value of a cozy space, and building it into a social experience that can scale into the future. In this talk, explore the approach taken, lessons learned along the way, and hopes the team has for the future.

直到最近，那些让人感到舒适的游戏和那些让人感到深度社交的游戏一直被视为互相排斥。竞技游戏可以讲述友谊和胜利的励志故事，但通常会出现很多玩家受挫而产生破坏性行为的例子，而许多舒适的游戏要么专注于单人体验，要么是有限的多人体验，这些体验在与陌生人的一次性互动之间，无法建立联系和与现有朋友进行更深层持续体验之间摇摆。通过Palia，团队旨在打入未解决的“舒适MMO”空间，利用社区模拟（Community Sim）类型，建立了一个具有明确基础和已认识到舒适空间价值的人群，并将其构建成一个可以面向未来扩展的社交体验。在本次讲话中，探讨所采取的方法、沿途所学到的经验教训以及团队对未来的期望。

In the process, they found out that the early access approach to developing content applies really well to "content-heavy" games.As a game designer and game director, Arthur focuses on the creative part of the discussion and see how this process can actually help you design fresh new and interesting content to keep player entertained and invested. He also addresses the flexibility and speed it gives, making it the perfect fit for a dense annual update planning.

六年前，《Dead Cells（死细胞）》早期版本发布后，游戏从未真正摆脱这种模式。在Motion Twin团队成功推出后，Evil Empire团队继续在此基础上多年进行改进。在这个过程中，他们发现早期版本发布方法在开发内容丰富的游戏中非常适用。作为游戏设计师和游戏总监，Arthur专注于讨论中的创意部分，并看到这一过程实际上如何帮助你设计新鲜有趣的内容，以保持玩家的娱乐和投入。他还提到这种方法带来的灵活性和速度，使其成为密集的年度更新计划的完美选择。

## Level Design Summit: Building Before 'Blockout': Better Communicating Your Design Before Placing Blocks

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/level-design-summit-building-before-blockout-better-communicating-your-design-before-placing-blocks/902427

作者：Luis Brito  (Senior Designer, Bungie)

This session will cover techniques that designers can use to improve how they communicate their designs. 


The session will begin with a brief introduction to the speaker, a few situations a designer might find themselves in, and a touch on how all design, including level design, is the ability to communicate ideas to an audience. 


We'll then dive into a short description of how the speaker has developed their own personal list of materials they use to better communicate their ideas.


Each material will be presented with a problem space to solve, the visuals and/or text that a designer can utilize to solve it, and applications of said visuals or text. 


Once all materials are covered, an example level will be shown that was built using the techniques shared.


The speaker will close the session with questions.

这个讲座将涵盖设计师可以使用的技术，以改善他们传达设计的能力。

讲座将以简短介绍发言人开始，列举设计师可能会遇到的一些情况，并简要介绍所有设计，包括关卡设计，都是向受众传达想法的能力。

然后，我们将简要描述发言人是如何开发他们自己的用于更好传达想法的材料清单的。

每种材料都将展示一个需要解决的问题空间，以及设计师可以利用的视觉和/或文本来解决问题，以及这些视觉或文本的应用。

在涵盖了所有材料之后，将展示一个使用分享的技巧构建的示例关卡。

发言人将在回答问题的环节结束讲座。

## Level Design Summit: How the Heck do you Teach Level Design?: Educating in the Studio

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/level-design-summit-how-the-heck-do-you-teach-level-design-educating-in-the-studio/900877

作者：Christopher Totten  (Program Coordinator and Founder, Kent State University & Pie for Breakfast Studios)

Ask anyone who has trained a new level designer or taught level design students, and they will tell you that a major challenge is balancing training for the technical aspects of the job while also teaching them "good" level design. In the studio environment, you also have to teach communication, documentation, designing for specific types of gameplay, or the elements of your studio's "style." How can we effectively mentor newcomers without taking time away from other ongoing design work? 


This talk by a level designer and educator with 13+ years of experience examines processes that studios can use to onboard new designers in productive and accessible ways. It does so through topics such as setting "learning goals", assigning quick-but-usable level design exercises, incorporating "style" into task specifications, and how to structure feedback. This talk incorporates both on-the-job knowledge and examples collected from education to build a roadmap for effective mentorship.

请问任何曾经培训过新关卡设计师或教授关卡设计学生的人，他们都会告诉你，在平衡技术工作的培训同时传授“好”的关卡设计时会面临很大的挑战。在工作室的环境中，你还需要教授沟通、文档编写、针对特定游戏玩法设计，或者工作室“风格”的元素。我们如何能够有效地指导新人，而不会占用其他正在进行的设计工作时间呢？

这场由一位拥有13年以上经验的关卡设计师和教育工作者主持的讲座，探讨了工作室可以采用的流程，以实现以高效且易接受的方式引入新设计师。这一过程涉及到设置“学习目标”、分配快速但实用的关卡设计练习、将“风格”融入任务规范以及如何构建反馈结构等课题。这场讲座既融合了职场知识，又搜集了来自教育领域的例证，为有效的指导工作提供了一份指南。

## Level Design Summit: Hyper-Modular Structures: Sins of a Level Designer

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/level-design-summit-hyper-modular-structures-sins-of-a-level-designer/902031

作者：Ankit  Kaushal  (Level Designer, SuperGaming)

The shortcomings and challenges of modular workflow for large-scale map production are often overlooked in favor of its alluring ease of execution and in-built optimization. This session aims to highlight the difficulties of adopting a modular workflow for relatively smaller and inexperienced teams and demystify some of the unrealistic expectations that come with it.


Investing a significant amount of time into engine tooling, runtime optimizations, and project maintenance utilities, the returns aren't always justifiable for the resources put into it.

大规模地图制作中模块化工作流程的缺点和挑战往往被忽视，而人们更倾向于其吸引人的执行便利性和内置优化。本次讨论旨在突出采用模块化工作流程对规模较小和经验不足团队的困难，并揭开一些不切实际的期望。

投入大量时间到引擎工具、运行时优化和项目维护工具中，回报未必总是能够补偿投入的资源。

作者：Anne-Marie Grönroos  (Lead Level Designer, Remedy Entertainment)

Alan Wake 2 is a survival horror game with a weird, complex story featuring two worlds and protagonists. This session covers how the mission structures evolved during development and what can go wrong when you combine puzzles, narrative, combat, and dream logic. Using the Proof of Concept missions as a case study, the talk shows how we structured the missions into various kinds of loops, the many failed attempts at designing dream logic, and how bringing the two protagonists closer helped us escape the nightmare New York.

《艾伦·韦克 2》是一款带有奇怪复杂故事情节的生存恐怖游戏，涵盖了两个世界和两名主角。本次讨论内容包括在开发过程中任务结构的演变以及当你将谜题、叙事、战斗和梦境逻辑结合时可能出现的问题。以概念验证任务作为案例研究，本次演讲展示了我们如何将任务组织成各种环路，设计梦境逻辑时的诸多失败尝试，以及如何使两位主角更加紧密接近帮助我们逃离噩梦般的纽约。

## Lore, Don't Tell: A Guide for Telling Culturally Rooted Stories Like 'Venba'

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/lore-dont-tell-a-guide-for-telling-culturally-rooted-stories-like-venba/902675

作者：Abhi  (Creative Director, Visai Games)

When players are unfamiliar with a culture, how do we tell a story that's rooted in it? It's a responsibility to ensure players who play the game leave with a deeper understanding of the culture, society, heritage and traditions we're showcasing. But the game we make has its own story to tell, and there might not be the space to be educating all players. It might also be tempting to explain and point out every aspect of the culture to ensure a player misses nothing, but this can do more harm than good. Thankfully, "Lore" is a very powerful tool that video games are great at that we can leverage to solve this problem. In this talk, Creative Director Abhi outlines various techniques used to follow a "Lore, don't tell" approach that let him not only be laser focused on the story he wanted to tell in Venba but also helped him shine a light on the culture he loves with all its details

当玩家对某个文化陌生时，我们如何讲述一个植根于该文化的故事呢？确保玩家在游戏结束时对我们展示的文化、社会、传统和遗产有更深刻的了解是一种责任。但我们制作的游戏有自己要讲述的故事，并且可能无法为所有玩家提供教育的空间。也许诱人的做法是解释并指出文化的每一个方面，以确保玩家不会错过任何细节，但这可能弊大于利。幸运的是，“传统”是一种非常强大的工具，而视频游戏擅长利用它来解决这个问题。在这次演讲中，创意总监阿比概述了各种采用“传统而非告知”方法的技巧，这让他不仅可以专注于他想要在《Venba》中讲述的故事，还帮助他揭示他热爱的文化及其所有细节。

## Lost the Plot: Writing Story for "Storyless" Games

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/lost-the-plot-writing-story-for-storyless-games/899138

作者：Ashley Reed  (Lead Writer, Respawn Entertainment)

Conventional wisdom says video game stories come in two flavors—elaborate cinematic experiences, or collections of barks and item descriptions glued together six months before launch. It's no surprise that game writers gravitate toward the first, but the truth is that there's space for narrative in even the sleekest platformer or most fast-paced shooter. In this talk, you will learn five key practices to create a story for your non-narrative game that feels meaningful, authentic, and satisfying—without a single cutscene or grenade bark in sight.

传统看法认为视频游戏的故事有两种风格——复杂的电影式体验，或是在上市前六个月将各类叫声和物品描述粘在一起。游戏编剧更倾向于前者并不奇怪，但事实是即使是最流畅的平台游戏或最快节奏的射击游戏中也有叙事的空间。在这个讨论中，你将学到五个关键实践，为你的非叙事游戏创造一个感觉有意义、真实和令人满意的故事——在没有任何过场动画或手榴弹叫声的情况下。

作者：Olivier Palmieri  (Game Director, Ubisoft Montreal)

Virtual Reality allows an amazing level of immersion in virtual worlds. But when it comes to locomotion, the ability to travel into these worlds may involve various degrees of discomfort, from fatigue to kinetosis (motion sickness). In Assassin's Creed Nexus VR, the open worlds of the game provide great opportunities for players to explore, parkour, climb, fight or go stealth, all of which presented unique challenges when designing a comfortable and accessible experience. The team presents the journey and share our experience working for several years on designing and building various features and presets to make the game comfortable and accessible for players. To conclude, the team presents features to help with potential fear of height, as players in Assassin's Creed Nexus VR will be able to parkour, climb and reach elevated heights, and can decide to experience the game's iconic leap of faith.

虚拟现实（Virtual Reality，VR）技术让人能够沉浸在虚拟世界中。但当涉及到运动时，进入这些虚拟世界可能会引起各种程度的不适，从疲劳到运动病（运动晕动病，kinetosis）。在'刺客信条：尼克斯 VR'中，游戏的开放世界为玩家提供了探索、跑酷、攀爬、战斗或潜行等许多机会，所有这些在设计舒适和易接近的体验时都带来了独特的挑战。团队展示了这一旅程，并分享了多年来致力于设计和构建各种功能和预设，以使游戏对玩家舒适且易接近的经验。最后，团队还提出了帮助玩家克服高处恐惧的功能，因为在'刺客信条：尼克斯 VR'中，玩家将能够通过跑酷、攀爬和抵达高处，选择是否体验游戏中标志性的信念之跃。

Remedy has never shied away from complex stories and characters, and Alan Wake 2 features some of our most ambitious protagonists to date. When it came to putting players in the minds of both a talented FBI detective piecing together a supernatural mystery, and a tortured author attempting to write his way out of a web of darkness, Lead Narrative Designer Simon Wasselin (Quantic Dream) Principal Narrative Designer Molly Maloney (Telltale Games) had to tackle some big questions: How do we give players a satisfying interactive experience within the confines of a linear story that can't budge? How do we allow for player expression when the protagonists are locked into specific roles? How can we leverage interactivity to incept complex, multilayered exposition into the minds of our audience?This talk focuses on the design of the narrative mechanics used to convey exposition in Alan Wake 2. Join us as we discuss the challenges of agency vs expression, linear vs branching storytelling, and how by involving Narrative Design in gameplay we can create more powerful story experiences in AAA games.

作者：Alexander Dawson  (Software Engineer, Meta)、Zack Dawson  (Game Designer, Meta)

When building a mixed-reality game, crafting and harmoniously blending two worlds into a single space is a fundamental challenge. Designing a game that incorporates the player's room as part of the level means losing out on a lot of control that fully pre-authored level design grants developers.


As a pack-in launch title for the Quest 3, Meta's First Encounters wowed players by smashing apart and opening their rooms to another world. Learn how the game was designed to make careful & considered use of the player's space as a core element of the game's design. Discover how the development team approached interactively transforming the player's space through a mixture of scene understanding & at-runtime procedural generation.


Game Designer Zachary Dawson and Game Programmer Alexander Dawson discuss the design, technical challenges, and solutions developed for turning every player's room into their own game world.

在开发混合现实游戏时，将两个世界巧妙地融合到一个单一空间中是一个基本挑战。设计一个游戏，将玩家的房间作为关卡的一部分意味着失去了完全预先设计的关卡所赋予开发者的许多控制。

作为奎斯特3的附赠首发游戏，《第一次相遇》通过将玩家的房间粉碎并打开到另一个世界，令玩家们惊叹不已。了解游戏是如何设计的，以便在核心设计中小心考虑并充分利用玩家的空间。了解开发团队如何通过一种混合的场景理解和运行时程序生成的方式来实现交互地转换玩家的空间。

游戏设计师扎卡里·道森和游戏程序员亚历山大·道森讨论了为了将每个玩家的房间转变为他们自己的游戏世界而开发的设计、技术挑战和解决方案。

## Minigames as Worldbuilding: Designing a Card Game for 'Saltsea Chronicles'

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/minigames-as-worldbuilding-designing-a-card-game-for-saltsea-chronicles/899064

作者：Ben Wilson  (Creative Producer, Die Gute Fabrik)、Daria Radu  (Game Programmer, Die Gute Fabrik, modl.ai)

Videogames often contain minigames or sub-systems (e.g. fishing, gambling) that allow the player to blow off steam and take a break from the main gameplay. But we can get even more ambitious in how those sub-systems serve the main story or worldbuilding. In this talk, two designers on story-driven adventure game Saltsea Chronicles recount the development of a trick-taking card game, Spoils, that was created for the project. In the fictional world of Saltsea Chronicles, each island community plays Spoils, but with their own house rules. First, this talk describes how the core Spoils mechanic was inspired by both the politics and history of the fictional world. Second, the talk explains how the rules variations were used to deepen the sense of place of each in-game locale. Games inevitably reflect their cultural context, and we can use that dynamic to heighten the meaning of minigames in larger videogame worlds.

电子游戏经常包含小游戏或子系统（例如钓鱼，赌博），使玩家能够释放压力，暂时脱离主要游戏玩法。但是我们可以在这些子系统如何为主要故事或世界构建作更有野心。在这次讲座中，《盐海编年史（Saltsea Chronicles）》叙述了以故事为驱动的冒险游戏中，两名设计师回顾了为项目创作的拖把牌游戏《战利品（Spoils）》的开发过程。在《盐海编年史》的虚构世界中，每个岛屿社区都玩《战利品》，但会遵循各自的规则。首先，这次讲座描述了核心《战利品》机制是如何受到虚构世界政治和历史的启发。其次，讲座解释了如何利用规则变化来加深每个游戏地点的氛围。游戏必然反映出其文化背景，我们可以利用这一动态来提升小游戏在更大电子游戏世界中的意义。

## Player Mythologies

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/player-mythologies/902656

作者：Alex Jaffe  (Game Design Manager, Riot Games)

Designers build games around player fantasies. These typically concern something the player "pretends" to be inside a game. But another kind of fantasy is often overlooked: "Player Mythologies". These are the narratives through which players view themselves as players. Explorer, spy, collector, artist - these archetypes don't just describe a character in a game. Remarkably, they sometimes describe the actual players, and how a specific game or genre fits into players' lives. By understanding these narratives, designers can gain profound insight into their players' mindset and motivation, reshaping traditional ideas of "good" and "bad" design. 


In this talk, Alex Jaffe introduces player mythologies, showing their impact and their root causes in subtle design choices. He then presents a case study on the player mythology of fighting games. He shows how this lens unlocked his work on Riot Games' Project L, and illuminates the beauty of the genre along the way.

设计师围绕玩家幻想构建游戏。这些幻想通常涉及玩家在游戏中所“假扮”的角色。但另一种常被忽视的幻想是：“玩家神话”。这些是玩家通过这些叙事视自己为玩家的方式。探险家、间谍、收集者、艺术家 - 这些原型不仅仅描述游戏中的角色。值得注意的是，有时候它们实际上描述的是玩家自身，以及特定游戏或流派如何融入玩家生活。通过理解这些叙事，设计师可以深刻洞察玩家的心态和动机，重塑“好”和“坏”设计的传统概念。

在这次演讲中，Alex Jaffe介绍了玩家神话，展示了它们在微妙设计选择中的影响和根源。然后，他提出了一个关于格斗游戏玩家神话的案例研究。他展示了这种视角如何解锁了他在Riot Games的“L计划”上的工作，并在此过程中阐明了这个流派的美丽。

## Prototyping Games in Figma: Leveraging Variables and Expressions

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/prototyping-games-in-figma-leveraging-variables-and-expressions/899649

作者：Mei Cheng  (Game Designer, Independent)

In this talk, I will present a tech demo that pushes the limit of Figma's new features, including variables, logic, and formulas. With Figma's new features, we will essentially be using Figma like a more powerful Twine. Prototypes can be easily strung together into a series of mockups that animate, follow logic, and imitate real-time interactions. This is especially useful for artists who want to design games, since the software is a lot like Photoshop or Illustrator.

在这次讲话中，我将展示一个技术演示，突显 Figma 新功能的极限，包括变量、逻辑和公式。借助 Figma 的新功能，我们实际上会将 Figma 用作更强大的 Twine。原型可以轻松地串联在一起，形成一系列的模拟，具有动画效果，遵循逻辑，并模拟实时交互。这对于想设计游戏的艺术家特别有用，因为这款软件非常类似于 Photoshop 或 Illustrator。

作者：Chris McEntee  (Game Design Director, Studio MDHR)

In 2019, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order established a traversal system that allowed Jedi Cal Kestis to creatively maneuver his way through lush alien worlds and imposing imperial bases. Throughout the production of 2023's Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, the team sought to refine and expand upon this foundation to not only provide players with new tools to explore its varied game worlds, but make both new and existing gameplay more refined, satisfying, fluid and fun. In this talk, Chris McEntee (Principal Game Designer on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor) will explore a series of concrete examples from the game, where they started, what was missing, and how the team developed player traversal to have more satisfying game feel across the board. Topics that will be touched on include embracing level design intent, expanding traversal opportunities for level designers and players, fluidity in motion, as well as simplification and general approachability.

在2019年，《星球大战绝地：陨落的秩序》建立了一个穿越系统，允许绝地武士卡尔·凯斯蒂斯在郁郁葱葱的外星世界和庞大的帝国基地中创造性地操纵自己的行进方式。在2023年的《星球大战绝地：幸存者》的制作过程中，团队致力于完善并扩展这一基础，不仅为玩家提供探索各种游戏世界的新工具，而且使新的和现有的游戏玩法更加精致、令人满足、流畅和有趣。在本次讲话中，克里斯·麦肯蒂（《星球大战绝地：幸存者》首席游戏设计师）将探讨游戏中一系列具体例子，包括起点、缺失之处以及团队如何发展玩家的穿越系统，以使整体游戏体验更加令人满意。涉及的主题包括拥抱关卡设计意图、为关卡设计师和玩家拓展穿越机会、动作的流畅性，以及简化和通用方法。

作者：Adam Noonchester  (Associate Game Director, Insomniac Games)

Boss fights with Spider-Man's rogues gallery are a key part of the fantasy, and delivering on them is a key component to the Marvel’s Spider-Man series. For the team, improving our boss-fights for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 meant leaning into core combat. This required making a lot of fundamental changes to how we designed and implemented bosses. This talk reveals design, programming and production lessons we learned as we went through this process. The attendees learn how we made unique, epic and memorable fights that achieved spectacle through core combat instead of via one-off, lock-and-key mechanics and disabling player abilities.

蜘蛛侠的反派大Boss对战是游戏中的重要组成部分，成功呈现这些对决是《漫威蜘蛛侠》系列的关键要素之一。为了给《漫威蜘蛛侠2》改进我们的Boss战，团队不得不深入探讨核心战斗。这需要我们对设计和实现Boss进行大量基础性改变。本次演讲将揭示我们在这一过程中所学到的设计、编程和制作经验。与会者将了解我们如何设计独特、史诗和难忘的对决，通过核心战斗来实现壮观，而非通过一次性机制和禁用玩家能力来达成。

作者：Chris Bourassa  (Co-Founder, Creative Director, Red Hook Studios, Inc.)、Tyler  Sigman  (Co-Founder, Design Director, Red Hook Studios, Inc)

Darkest Dungeon II is a striking departure from the original, by design. Defying conventional wisdom, we risked everything to create a tonally and mechanically different sequel. Being a boutique independent developer meant the stakes were extremely high. We remained committed to our vision as we traversed the rocky road of logistical, technical, and creative challenges over the game's 4+ year development cycle. This talk outlines the journey we took in designing our sophomore effort, unpacking our process, our fears, and our failures with candor and honesty. It was not an easy undertaking, but nothing worth doing ever is.

《黑暗地牢II》是一次从原作中引人瞩目的改变，这是经过精心设计的。我们打破了常规的智慧，冒险一搏，创造了一部在氛围和机制上截然不同的续作。作为一家精品独立开发者，风险极高。在整个游戏的四年多开发周期中，我们始终坚守自己的愿景，克服了物流、技术和创意挑战的坎坷道路。这次讨论将梳理我们在设计第二作中走过的路程，揭示我们的流程、恐惧和失败，坦诚和诚实。这并非易事，但任何值得做的事情都不会轻而易举。

## Starting A Story You Can Finish: Narrative Design Structure and Scope

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/starting-a-story-you-can-finish-narrative-design-structure-and-scope/903650

作者：Aevee Bee  (Narrative Designer, Future Club)

Writing is hard enough; but the even harder part is figuring out where all the writing is supposed to fit! Are you working on a fast-paced game, squeezing all the story you can in the tiny cracks between gameplay? Or are you building a massive, branching narrative and living in fear of it collapsing into a spaghetti mess and spilling all over your freshly-waxed kitchen floor, which I guess symbolizes budget and/or scope at this point? This talk will cover how to plan a narrative that won't become as unwieldy as the metaphor in the previous sentence. We will cover techniques for structuring a story manageable for audiences to read and for writers to write, as well as how to apply these narrative design principles to both design-centric and narrative-centric projects.

写作本身已经够难了；更困难的部分是弄清楚所有写作应该放在哪里！你是在忙于开发一个节奏快速的游戏，把所有故事都挤进游戏玩法之间的狭缝吗？还是在构建一个庞大的、分支式叙事，生怕它会崩溃成一团乱麻，溢出并弄脏刚打蜡的厨房地板，我猜这可能象征着在这一点上的预算和/或范围？本次讨论将涵盖如何规划一个故事，使其不会像前一句比喻那样难以控制。我们将介绍结构故事的技巧，使其易于观众阅读和作者书写，以及如何将这些叙事设计原则应用于以设计为中心或以叙事为中心的项目。

作者：Daniel Benmergui  (Director, Storyteller)

Storyteller is a puzzle game about building stories. But it turns out people have a lot of expectations about how stories are supposed to work, so how do you design a game that accomodates a soft skill that is shaped differently across cultures, game literacy and even age? This talk is a distillation of everything we learned in the 15 years it took to reach a satisfying design for a game that allows people to play with stories instead of passively consuming them.

《故事讲述者》是一款关于构建故事的益智游戏。但事实证明，人们对故事应如何运作有许多期待。那么，您要如何设计一个游戏来适应一个在不同文化、游戏素养甚至年龄中呈现不同形态的软技能？这个讲座是我们在15年时间内学到的一切的凝练，以获得一款游戏的令人满意的设计，让人们可以玩弄故事，而不是被动消费它们。

作者：Terry Li  (Senior Level Designer, miHoYo Co., Ltd.)

Designing open worlds is one thing, designing them for time-limited events is another. The latter requires designers to use core elements of the event format, such as time-limitedness and event phases to deliver unique exploration experiences to players. 

In this session, Terry Li introduces the creative workings of Genshin Impact's highly anticipated summer event maps which have been ongoing since 2021. 

By analyzing some examples over the past three years, Terry aims to equip attendees with a set of design tips that are critical to creating memorable event maps, a task and challenge that could be faced by most live-op games. He will dive deeper into the techniques applied to time-limiting theme quests, creatively and naturally revealing new regions, and aligning activities with the open-world exploration experience.

设计开放世界是一回事，为限时活动设计开放世界则是另一回事。后者要求设计师运用活动形式的核心元素，比如限时性和活动阶段，以向玩家提供独特的探索体验。

在这个讨论中，Terry Li介绍了备受期待的《原神》自2021年以来持续举办的夏季活动地图的创意设计。

通过分析过去三年的一些示例，Terry旨在为与会者提供一套关键的设计技巧，这些技巧对于创建令人难忘的活动地图至关重要，这是大多数在线运营游戏可能面临的任务和挑战。他将深入探讨应用于限时主题任务的技术，创造性而自然地揭示新区域，并将活动与开放世界探索体验相匹配。

作者：Karel Crombecq  (Lead Developer, Briganti)

In 2021, artist Wim De Hert proposed a wild idea to a friend: "What if we do Townscaper, but for Dungeon Masters? What if we use procedural generation technology so anyone can easily make high-quality fantasy maps to use in their tabletop RPGs, and they can do this in minutes instead of hours?"In this talk, the lead developer of Dungeon Alchemist takes you on the journey that started with this simple idea and resulted in one of the most successful Kickstarters of all time (> $3M raised) and in an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam with continuously high sales and a vibrant, positive community. It's the story of how combining digital technology with tabletop RPGs changed the way people play and make games.

在2021年，艺术家Wim De Hert向一个朋友提出了一个疯狂的想法：“如果我们为地牢主们做一个类似Townscaper的游戏呢？我们利用程序生成技术，让任何人都能轻松制作高质量的幻想地图，用于他们的桌面角色扮演游戏，而且他们可以在几分钟内完成，而不是几个小时。”在这个讲座中，Dungeon Alchemist的首席开发者带领你探索了从这个简单想法开始的旅程，最终成为有史以来最成功的Kickstarter之一（筹集超过300万美元），在Steam上获得了“极度正面”的评价，持续高销量，并拥有一个充满活力和正能量的社区。这是一个数字技术与桌面角色扮演游戏相结合如何改变人们玩游戏和制作游戏的故事。

## Tabletop Summit: Making 'Fallout' for Tabletop (or How to Be Different but the Same)

作者：James Sheahan  (Senior Game Designer, The Multiplayer Group)

Converting a videogame to a tabletop game should be simple - it provides a setting, game mechanics, and an existing audience. But how much should it be like the videogame and/or other games? If it's too similar, players won't need it. If it's too different, players won't like it.


Formed over 4 years of designing Fallout: Wasteland Warfare and all of its expansions, campaigns, AI and RPG (plus 20+ years of game design experience), this talk examines how Bethesda's award-winning Fallout videogame series was converted to the tabletop game of Fallout: Wasteland Warfare.


Using examples, this talk looks at the problems of the task and the methods used to solve them. Plus, the talk examines the deeper, ever-present question during this type of development: When to be the same and when to be different, in terms of the game mechanics, the setting and the competition.

将视频游戏转换为桌面游戏本应该很简单 - 它提供了一个背景设定、游戏机制和一个现有的受众群体。但它到底应该有多少像视频游戏和/或其他游戏呢？如果太相似，玩家就不需要它。如果太不同，玩家就不会喜欢它。

经过4年时间设计《辐射：荒野战争》及其所有扩展、战役、人工智能和角色扮演（以及20年以上的游戏设计经验），本次演讲探讨了Bethesda屡获殊荣的《辐射》视频游戏系列是如何被转换为桌面游戏《辐射：荒野战争》。

通过案例，本次演讲讨论了这一任务的问题和解决方法。此外，演讲探讨了在这种类型的开发中始终存在的更深层次问题：何时保持一致，何时有所不同，无论是在游戏机制、背景设定还是竞争方面。

## Tabletop Summit: The Elements of TTRPGS: A Starting Point

作者：Pamela Punzalan  (Executive Director, Dames Making Games Toronto)、Indrani Ganguly  (Studio Head / Game Designer, Duronto Games)

If film, video games, and fiction can have elements, what are the elements of tabletop roleplaying games? This panel presents a rubric for general elements that can be found in most, if not all, tabletop roleplaying games. It is less about establishing universal principles that will make a tabletop roleplaying game "bad" or "good," and more about starting a discussion about tabletop games that players and designers can both benefit from. Any kind of review or critical discussion about a games medium cannot start without definitions. By dissecting these nine elements —Fantasy, World, Body, Tension, Design, Principles, Form, Touch, and Intent—the panel presents important questions that designers may ask themselves during the practice of their art. And, through providing starting definitions and presenting examples of tabletop games themselves, create critical scaffolding for tabletop roleplaying games as a vehicle for storytelling.

如果电影、电子游戏和小说可以有要素，那桌面角色扮演游戏有哪些要素呢？本专题提供了一个用于概括绝大多数，如果不是全部，桌面角色扮演游戏中可找到的一般要素的分类表。这并不是要建立一套能让一个桌面角色扮演游戏变得“糟糕”或“优秀”的通用原则，而更多的是要启动一场关于桌面游戏的讨论，让玩家和设计师都能从中受益。任何有关对游戏媒介的评论或批评性讨论，在没有定义的情况下就无从开始。通过剖析这九个要素——幻想（Fantasy）、世界（World）、身体（Body）、紧张（Tension）、设计（Design）、原则（Principles）、形态（Form）、感受（Touch）和意图（Intent）——这专题提出了设计师在实践艺术过程中可能会问自己的重要问题。而且，通过提供初始定义并展示桌面游戏的例子，为桌面角色扮演游戏作为讲故事手段构建了批评性的脚手架。

作者：Cabel Sasser  (Co-Founder, Panic)

Imagine a company that has only ever made easily-downloadable computer software deciding to suddenly jump into an entirely new world of creation: hardware. A company that’s used to almost any problem being solved by hitting a breakpoint and entering a debugger, suddenly facing a universe of atoms, and physics, and far-away factories with lots (and lots) of uncontrollable variables, not to mention shipping companies.Ridiculous? Yes. (Ultimately) successful? Also yes!The journey of creating Playdate, our indie bright-yellow handheld video game system (and now, platform!) was fulfilling, but also challenging, but also really fulfilling. And if you some time to spare, I’d love to share with you a collection of stories about the ups, downs, and inside-outs of hardware development, some key learning moments we had along the way, and maybe even some thoughts about just, you know, running a business in general. Let’s have some fun!

想象一家只生产易于下载的计算机软件的公司，突然决定跳入一个全新的创作世界：硬件。一个习惯于几乎任何问题都能通过击中断点并进入调试器来解决的公司，突然面对一个由原子、物理和遥远的工厂以及无法控制的很多（非常多）变量组成的宇宙，更不用说运输公司了。荒谬？是的。最终成功？同样是！创造《Playdate》，我们那款明亮的黄色独立手持式视频游戏系统（现在还是一个平台！）的旅程是充满成就感的，但也充满挑战，同时也真正充实。如果你有一些空闲时间，我很乐意与你分享一系列关于硬件开发过程中坎坷、挑战和内外的故事，我们沿途学到的一些关键经验，甚至也许一些关于经营企业的思考。让我们玩得开心吧！

作者：Brett Taylor  (Solo Developer, My Dog Zorro)

While puzzles should often be confounding, talking about puzzles should NOT be. Have you ever thought "Wow, this puzzle is really fun and elegant!", but couldn't quite articulate why? What about "This puzzle I've made is beautiful, but play testers don't like it, and I don't know what to change." Or maybe you've just started out making puzzles and want to understand what the heck goes into the design process. This talk has you covered!This session is about the words and concepts we can use, not just to describe, but to THINK about our puzzles and design process. There are many, many axes to puzzle design, and the more clarity and vocabulary we have about what we're doing, the easier it is to make-- and talk about-- great puzzles.

拼图游戏常常应当是复杂的，但讨论拼图不应如此。你是否曾想过：“哇，这个拼图真的很有趣而且优雅！”却无法准确表达原因？又或者是：“我设计的这个拼图很精美，但试玩者不喜欢，我不知道该如何改进。”或许你刚开始制作拼图游戏，想要了解设计过程中的奥秘。本讲座正是为你而准备的！这个环节关于我们可以使用的单词和概念，不仅是用来描述，而是用来思考我们的拼图和设计过程。拼图设计有许多方面，如果我们对自己正在做的事情有更清晰与丰富的词汇和概念，那么制作出优秀的拼图——以及谈论它们——就会更容易。

## UX Summit: Difficult Games by Data and Design

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/ux-summit-difficult-games-by-data-and-design/901575

作者：Sebastian Long  (Managing Director, Player Research)、Lanie Dixon  (Director of Insights, Ubisoft Montreal)

Deciding your games difficulty is, ironically, difficult


Finding 'Goldilocks' frustration — not too hard, not too easy — is perilously tough. Player feedback is essential in the search for 'just right': finding players' 'flow' by controlling the many variables, and examining the experiential outcomes.


Capturing player data on difficulty offers clarity, but also potential ruin. There are many approaches to game balancing through feedback: internal play sessions, analytics, user research, QA and more… In isolation each is a flawed and biased picture of 'difficulty'. Only in combination can these approaches paint the full picture, directing teams to make confident and effective adjustments to difficulty balance.


This talk presents practical, player-centric, tried-and-tested approaches to capture feedback on game difficulty from players and peers, bringing together lessons from multiple genres. Attendees will leave with a clear strategy on how to define difficulty, and how player feedback can make it easier to make the game harder.

确定游戏的难度，具有讽刺意味，是困难的

找到“金发姑娘”式的挑战，既不太难也不太容易，是非常困难的。玩家反馈在寻找“恰到好处”的过程中至关重要：通过控制许多变量，并检查体验结果来找到玩家的“心流”。

收集有关难度的玩家数据可以提供清晰度，但也可能导致破坏。通过反馈有许多游戏平衡的方法：内部游戏测试会话、分析、用户研究、质量保证等等…每种方法单独看都是“难度”的一个受缺陷和有偏见的图像。只有结合这些方法，才能描绘出全貌，从而指导团队进行自信和有效的难度平衡调整。

这篇演讲介绍了实用、以玩家为中心、经得住考验的方法，旨在收集来自玩家和同行对游戏难度的反馈，汇集了多种类型的经验教训。与会者将学会如何明确定义难度，并了解玩家反馈如何能够使游戏更加容易使游戏更加困难。
