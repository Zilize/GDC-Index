作者：Pablo Quarta  (Narrative Designer and Producer, Matajuegos)

Atuel is a surrealist documentary videogame about a river that flows across Argentina's Cuyo Desert and how the global climate crisis is threatening its historical ecosystem. Created in collaboration with a team of documentarians, featuring real-world interviews with experts, and focusing on dreamlike portrayals of native species and iconic topography, Atuel is a poetic and meditative game that has gone on to win IndieCade's "Innovation in Experience Design Award" and has been exhibited at documentary festivals, art exhibits, and design museums across the world.


Matajuegos, the game workers' co-op behind the development of Atuel, break down the game's production process, dig into their approach to the documentary genre, and explain the art and design philosophies that made such a hyperlocal Latin American story stand out globally.

Atuel 是一款关于阿根廷库约沙漠中一条流过的河流的超现实主义纪录片视频游戏，探讨全球气候危机对其历史生态系统的威胁。与一支纪录片团队合作打造，采访了真实世界的专家，侧重展现了梦幻般的原生物种和标志性地形，Atuel 是一款富有诗意和沉思的游戏，赢得了IndieCade的“体验设计创新奖”，并在世界各地的纪录片节、艺术展览和设计博物馆展出。

Matajuegos，Atuel 开发背后的游戏工作者合作社，解析了游戏的制作过程，深入探讨了他们对纪录片类型的处理方式，并解释了使这样一个高度本土化的拉丁美洲故事在全球脱颖而出的艺术和设计哲学。

作者：Pietro Righi Riva  (Studio Director, Santa Ragione)

In this talk, the game director of third person survival horror Saturnalia tells the story of its overly ambitious and troubled six-year development, outlining the radical changes in scope, design and looks that allowed the team to fund the game and eventually ship it. 


A rendering style change inspired by a tweet, a mid-development shift from first to third-person, three years of pitching to more than ninety publishers, and the design challenges of a multi-character proc-narrative rogue-lite exploration-driven title inspired by the folklore of Sardinia, Italy. In short, the ups and downs of making a game that was a grand prize finalist at IndieCade and A MAZE, and an IGF Seumas McNally Grand Prize Honorable Mention.

在这个讲话中，第三人称生存恐怖游戏《Saturnalia》的游戏总监讲述了其六年的过度雄心勃勃且饱受困扰的开发历程，概述了在范围、设计和外观上进行的彻底改变，使团队能够筹集资金开发游戏并最终发布。

受推特启发而进行的渲染风格改变，从第一人称到第三人称的中期开发变化，持续三年向九十多家发行商推销的经历，以及从意大利撒丁岛民间传说灵感而来的多角色进程故事魔幻风格探险游戏的设计挑战。简而言之，游戏制作的起起落落，成为IndieCade和A MAZE大奖决赛入围者，以及IGF Seumas McNally大奖荣誉提名游戏。

作者：Neha Patel  (Composer/Sound Designer, Independent)

The sound of Venba was aimed with one thought in mind: ''Hear the sounds of my Indian home''. Neha's motto for creating the soundscape for the game was that it had to be authentic to the culture the game represents. This meant understanding the history, the culture, and of course the cooking methods. Neha will explain the recording process for the variety of foods, using the appropriate kitchenware and being aware of how to best represent the subtilties that are part of everyday life in a South Asian household. A variety of videos demonstrating the recording process as well as their in-game usage will be demonstrated.

Venba 的音效创作以一个念头为目标：''聆听我印度家园的声音''。 Neha 创作游戏音效的座右铭是，音效必须忠实于游戏所代表的文化。这意味着理解历史、文化，当然还有烹饪方法。 Neha 将会解释各种食物的录制过程，使用适当的厨具，并且要了解如何最好地展现南亚家庭日常生活中的细微差别。将展示一系列视频，演示录制过程以及它们在游戏中的应用。

## Independent Games Summit: A Case for Making Your Own Engine

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/independent-games-summit-a-case-for-making-your-own-engine/901862

作者：Rez Graham  (Creative / Technical Director, Independent)

There are a nearly endless set of engines to choose from out from massive AAA behemoths like Unreal to much smaller engines like Godot or even RenPy. Each of these engines offers a starting point, but they all come at a cost. Some of that cost is financial, but much of the cost is in the form of constraints on the game design or even the technical feasibility of a project. The alternative is to build an engine from scratch, which is often seen as completely untenable.


This session will discuss when and why one might consider building their own game engine. It will walk through the various considerations and break down the cost/benefit analysis. Attendees will gain a value insight into what it would really take to build something simple and usable.

在游戏开发领域可以选择的引擎几乎无穷无尽，从庞大的 AAA 级引擎如虚幻引擎到更小型的引擎如 Godot 或者 RenPy。每个引擎都提供了一个起点，但它们都是有代价的。其中一部分成本是财务成本，但更多的成本体现在对游戏设计的限制，甚至对项目技术可行性的约束上。另一种选择是从零开始构建一个引擎，但这通常被认为是完全不可行的。

这个讨论会探讨在何时以及为什么应考虑构建自己的游戏引擎。它将详细讨论各种考虑因素，并分析成本/收益关系。与会者将深入了解构建一个简单可用的引擎实际需要付出的努力。

## Independent Games Summit: A Decade Unveiled: The Brazilian Indie Game Scene's Transformative Journey

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/independent-games-summit-a-decade-unveiled-the-brazilian-indie-game-scenes-transformative-journey/901445

作者：Arthur Protasio  (Founder & CEO, Fableware)、Bruno Campagnolo de Paula  (Course Coordinator, PUC-PR)、Ana Ribeiro  (Game Director, Arvore Immersive Experiences)、Thais Weiller  (Game Designer and Producer, JoyMasher)、Sandro Manfredini  (Business Development Director, Epic Games)

Five diverse game devs come together to share their stories and how they all originated from the same ecosystem: the Brazilian Indie Scene.


Over the past 10 years, Brazil has seen nearly a tenfold increase in the number of game development companies. From 133 incorporated studios, there are now over 1000, with an estimated 10,000 workers in the industry. We revealed this budding indie game industry back at a GDC talk in 2014 and, now, we have come full circle, with an understanding of the reasons why the Brazilian community has experienced this growth. It's been driven by the strength of regional developer communities as well as individual actions that have infused regional DNA into various globally successful games.


Game developers from titles like Horizon Chase, Pixel Rift, Blazing Chrome, and Sword Legacy: Omen will discuss how they learned to deal with this scenario and came out victorious from it. They'll explain how certain definitions of success don't translate equally across the world, highlight diverse cultural, economic, social landscapes that shaped individual achievements, and inspire you to do the same.

五位不同背景的游戏开发者聚在一起分享他们的故事，以及他们是如何源于同一个生态系统：巴西独立游戏圈。


在过去的10年里，巴西的游戏开发公司数量几乎增长了十倍。从133家注册工作室，现在已经超过1000家，该行业估计有1万名员工。我们在2014年的GDC演讲中揭示了这个新兴的独立游戏行业，现在，我们已经全面了解了巴西社区为何会经历这种增长。这种增长受到了地区开发者社区的力量驱动，以及注入地区DNA到各种在全球取得成功的游戏中的个人行动。


来自《地平线追逐》、《像素裂缝》、《烈焰铬合金》和《剑之传承：厄运》等游戏开发者将讨论他们是如何学会应对这种情况，并从中成功脱颖而出的。他们将解释成功的某些定义在世界各地并不一致，突出多样化的文化、经济、社会景观如何塑造了个人成就，并激励你做同样的事情。

## Independent Games Summit: CSharpify your Engine: A Guide to Embedding C#

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/independent-games-summit-csharpify-your-engine-a-guide-to-embedding-c/902164

作者：Andreia Gaita  (CEO, Principal Tech Lead, Spoiled Cat)

C# is a very popular language, and there are a lot of C# developers out there. There is a constant desire for these C# skills to be transferable across game engines, and this is especially true given the recent events surrounding Unity, and the increasing popularity of alternative engines targeting the indie dev market.


But how transferable are C# skills from engine to engine? How do you evaluate the viability of the C# support on an engine you don't know? AOT, JIT, Mono, what are all of these words? You want to embed C# in your engine, how do you do that?


This talk will cover what you need to know about C# and the .NET ecosystem in the games industry, clarifying the jargon, going over existing engine support, explaining platform constraints, portability, and providing pratical examples of how to embed C# in a game engine, as well as relevant online resources.

C# 是一种非常流行的编程语言，世界上有很多C#开发人员。人们一直希望这些C#技能可以在不同的游戏引擎之间转换，尤其是考虑到围绕Unity发生的最近事件，以及针对独立开发者市场的另类引擎日益增长的受欢迎程度。

但是，C#技能在不同引擎之间到底有多容易转换？你如何评估在未知引擎上的C#支持的可行性？AOT、JIT、Mono，所有这些词是什么意思？如果你想要将C#嵌入到你的引擎中，该如何做呢？

本次交流将涵盖你在游戏行业中需要了解的有关C#和.NET生态系统的知识，澄清术语，介绍现有引擎的支持情况，解释平台约束，可移植性，并提供如何在游戏引擎中嵌入C#的实际示例，以及相关的在线资源。

## Independent Games Summit: Challenging or Approachable? Pick Two

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/independent-games-summit-challenging-or-approachable-pick-two/902332

作者：John Austin  (Founder, Pontoco)

You've probably heard this debate before. It's a common belief that challenge and approachability are incompatible – that making a game more challenging inherently makes a game less approachable. And yet, we *can* have both! In fact, many recent indie hits are successful precisely because they thread this needle. In this talk, John Austin will break this problem down on a (not too) theoretical level and build a framework we can use to talk about difficulty in games. In the second half, he will explore concrete strategies and case studies from recent indie games that we can leverage to adjust approachability in our games – without compromising on challenge or the inherent vision of the game.

你可能之前听过这场辩论。一种普遍观念认为挑战和易接近性是不相容的 - 认为使游戏更具挑战性会使游戏变得不易接近。但是，我们*可以*两者兼得！事实上，许多最近的独立游戏作品之所以成功，正是因为它们成功地平衡了这一点。在这次讲座中，约翰·奥斯汀将会将这个问题拆解到一个（不太）理论层面，并建立一个框架，让我们能够讨论游戏难度。在后半部分，他将探讨最近独立游戏中的具体策略和案例研究，我们可以借鉴这些内容来调整我们游戏中的易接近性 - 而不会牺牲挑战性或游戏的固有愿景。

作者：Joe Mirabello  (Founder and Director, Terrible Posture Games)

So you've released that Indie-Game you've been working on for five years and now you're wondering... what's next? You've refined your pipeline, honed your skills, and spent years building up a great team and studio to work at, but unless you find yourself in a runaway hit situation, it's time to get serious. You're not AAA, but you're no longer a spare-time Indie... you're Post Indie. In this deep dive into a small studios' ten year history, we examine the blurry line between "hobby studio" and "career", between niche products and AAA brands, and between staying scrappy and being professional, all while building a reputation, surviving a bleak landscape, and, above all, being a steward for the livelihoods your team has entrusted to your leadership.

## Independent Games Summit: Making Accessible Games with Indie Resources

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/independent-games-summit-making-accessible-games-with-indie-resources/902373

作者：Matt MacLean  (CEO / Designer, Generic Lake Monster)

People might disagree on how much challenge is the perfect amount, but even fans of masochistically difficult games will agree: losing because you made the wrong decision has the potential to be fun, but losing because you're in a struggle with the controller or the interface is the stuff of rage-quitting. Thinking about players with hands, eyes, minds, schedules, and distractions different than your own is neither free, nor easy, but with less demands to cater to the common denominators, independent game studios are best positioned to serve these players. Drawing from four years of success and setbacks making Quarterstaff, an accessibility-focused game, this talk is about using accessibility as a baseline of success and a core design constraint, as well as best practices for making sure usability is an ongoing component of development that makes your game stand out, and not a costly last-minute addition.

人们对于游戏挑战的程度可能存在分歧，但即使对 masochistically 困难游戏的粉丝也会认同：因为做出了错误决策而失败有可能会带来乐趣，但因为与控制器或界面的斗争而失败会导致怒气冲冲地退出游戏。考虑到玩家手部、眼睛、思维、时间表以及其他个人差异，这既不是免费的，也不容易，但独立游戏工作室在服务这些玩家方面处于最佳位置，因为他们没有受制于通用要求。借鉴四年来为以无障碍为重点的游戏《Quarterstaff》取得的成功和挫折，本次讨论是关于将无障碍性作为成功的基准和核心设计约束，以及确保可用性是持续开发的最佳实践，使您的游戏脱颖而出，而不是一个昂贵的临时增加物。

What’s an indie game dev to do when the market for project funding appears upside down compared to a mere 12 months ago? Pitching and securing funding is a slog and not for the faint of heart. But it gets easier when you can walk in knowing what to expect from the process, are prepared for the inevitable curveballs thrown your way, and are informed of what NOT to do when it comes to lining up funding for your projects. Developers from across the indie dev landscape share their tales from the pitching and funding trenches to help you better navigate the often rocky road to project funding.

Industry has been wracked with studio closure after closure, an increased lack of support, and an ever-tightening job market, leaving many developers feeling frustrated and devalued. But before you resign…. have you thought about starting your own studio to make that change yourself?

To accomplish that, our speakers will provide actionable resources, tools, and best practices to help you embody a developer-centered culture. Topics will specifically speak to the process of building a studio, and address the following questions: What inspired your studio to take a people-first philosophy? How do you walk the walk, and what are the stumbling blocks you've found along the route? With this shift, what worked, what had to change, and why is that unique to this perspective? How has this belief enabled you to recruit and retain diverse employees?

The road to making a better industry is challenging, but the value of making a safe space for developers to thrive in is worth it. The speakers in these talks will share their experiences transparently, believing that each new successful people-first studio will build towards a more sustainable future for independent developers and industry as a whole.

游戏开发领域已经遭受了一波接一波的工作室倒闭，支持不足的困境以及日益紧张的就业市场，让许多开发者感到沮丧和被低估。但在你选择放弃之前，你有没有考虑过自己开设一个工作室，来做出改变呢？

为了实现这一目标，我们的演讲嘉宾将提供可操作的资源、工具和最佳实践，帮助你营造一个以开发者为中心的文化。演讲主题将具体涉及建立工作室的过程，并解答以下问题：是什么激发了你们的工作室采取以人为本的理念？你们是如何践行这一理念的，以及在前进的道路上遇到了哪些阻碍？随着这种转变，哪些做法奏效了，哪些不得不改变，而这种独特的观点又为何被启用？这种信念如何帮助你们吸引和留住多样化的员工？

通往创造一个更好工业的道路充满挑战，但为开发者提供一个安全成长空间的价值是不言而喻的。这些演讲者将公开分享他们的经验，相信每一个成功的以人为本的工作室都将有助于为独立开发者和整个产业构建更加可持续的未来。

作者：Tomas Sala  (Creator, Tomas Sala)

"Why launching an evolving demo is a good idea, but not always" In this talk, solo developer Tomas Sala will do a brief post-mortem on the evolving demo he launched for The Falconeer: Bulwark.


He'll explain the difference between doing an evolving demo (a free experience that is updated and improved publicly) and a paid Early Access release, Sala will discuss pro's and cons of both scenario's and what motivated him to do this open development thru a steam demo.


He will discuss why the evolving demo worked great for his latest game, but why it might not be the best option for every game or even for every phase of development. Other developers can use his valuable insights to choose the best option for the game they are working on.

"为什么推出一个不断发展的演示版是一个好主意，但并非总是" 在这次讲演中，独立开发者Tomas Sala将简要总结他为《猎鹰手：堡垒》推出的不断发展的演示版。


他将解释进行不断发展的演示版（一个公开更新和改进的免费体验）与付费的抢先体验版本之间的区别。Sala将讨论两种情况的利弊，并解释他做出通过Steam演示进行开放式开发的动机。


他将讨论为什么不断发展的演示版对他最新游戏效果很好，但为什么它可能并非对每款游戏或甚至每个开发阶段都是最佳选择。其他开发者可以借鉴他宝贵的见解，选择最适合他们正在开发的游戏的最佳方案。

## Independent Games Summit: Saunas, Buses, and Tandem Bikes: Stories of Finnish Game Jams

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/independent-games-summit-saunas-buses-and-tandem-bikes-stories-of-finnish-game-jams/902096

作者：Annakaisa Kultima  (Founder, Finnish Game Jam)

In this talk, I will take you through some of the quirkiest, heartwarming, creative, and inspiring stories from Finnish game jams. While Finland is officially hailed as 'the happiest country in the world,' it harbors a unique secret: we create games in the most unconventional places. While saunas are a common feature of Finnish game jams, our more exotic adventures have taken place in a wintry cottage, a Sami tent (teepee), planetariums, alongside quantum computers, aboard a Ferris wheel, and even on a tandem bike. When playfully brainstorming new game jam ideas in Finland, you must be cautious because they might just become a reality. Although it's challenging to surpass the rich history of Finnish game jams, the purpose of this presentation is to inspire you to elevate your own game jams. Who knows, one day, someone might organize a game jam at the International Space Station.

在这次讲话中，我将带领大家了解一些来自芬兰游戏开发马拉松的最古怪、最暖心、最有创意和最鼓舞人心的故事。虽然芬兰正式被誉为“世界上最幸福的国家”，但它隐藏着一个独特的秘密：我们在最不寻常的地方创造游戏。尽管在芬兰游戏开发马拉松中桑拿是一种常见元素，但我们更加奇特的冒险发生在冬季小屋、萨米人帐篷（圆锥形帐篷）、天文馆、量子计算机旁边、摩天轮上，甚至是骑在双人自行车上。在芬兰轻松愉快地头脑风暴新的游戏开发马拉松创意时，你必须小心，因为它们可能会变成现实。虽然要超越芬兰游戏开发马拉松丰富的历史是具有挑战性的，但这次演讲的目的是激励你提升自己的游戏开发马拉松。谁知道，也许有一天，有人会在国际空间站组织一个游戏开发马拉松。

作者：Kirsty Gillmore  (Voice, Performance and Casting Director, Sounds Wilde)

How do we tell stories which are based around sensitive and heavy themes? And how do we endeavor to portray an emotionally challenging, intimate narrative, as unflinchingly as possible, without causing trauma to a development team? Voice & Casting Director Kirsty Gillmore explores how Silver Script Games approached the creation of autobiographical narrative game The Quiet Things, which tells the story of Alice from childhood to late teens and her experiences with child abuse, mental health and trauma, with a deep focus on storytelling through audio. CW: this talk will include reference to themes of childhood abuse, self-harm, mental health, attempted suicide, grooming and sexual abuse.

我们如何讲述围绕敏感和沉重主题的故事？我们如何努力以尽可能坦率的方式呈现令人情感挑战的亲密叙事，而不会给开发团队造成创伤？配音与选角总监 Kirsty Gillmore 探讨了 Silver Script Games 如何着手创作自传故事游戏《The Quiet Things》，该游戏讲述了从童年到青少年时期的爱丽丝（Alice）的故事，以及她经历的童年虐待、心理健康和创伤，着重通过音频进行叙事。注意：这次讲座将涉及到童年虐待、自我伤害、心理健康、自杀未遂、慕赞和性虐待等主题。

## Independent Games Summit: The Black Gamic Language

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/independent-games-summit-the-black-gamic-language/902585

作者：Spencer Garland  (CEO/Creative Director, BRENDA ARTS, LLC.)

Hype Williams, but for Video Games?!?


This presentation speaks to the newfound formation of a Black Gamic Language. In a similar way that Gordon Parks, Marvin Van Peebles, Spike Lee, John Singleton, The Wayans Brothers, Ava DuVernay, Cheryl Dunye, Boots Riley, and Terrance Nance developed what Black TV and movies can be, Spencer Garland, along with other developers, are adding their ideas into what Black games can be. What new inherently Black genres can be added to the medium of video games? What characters or worlds can be created? To reference Andrew Benjamin, "Black game devs have something to say!"


This presentation will go over the history of Black life represented in games, understanding media literacy surrounding stereotypical depictions of BIPOC people in games, the history of BIPOC game devs, and who is actively working to dismantle the systems that exclude Black life/joy in the medium. Discourse about BIPOC aesthetics from film and how they can be translated into a gamic medium will also be expressed.

这段内容探讨了关于全新形成的黑人游戏语言。类似于 Gordon Parks, Marvin Van Peebles, Spike Lee, John Singleton, The Wayans Brothers, Ava DuVernay, Cheryl Dunye, Boots Riley, 和 Terrance Nance 塑造了黑人电视和电影的形象一样，Spencer Garland 和其他开发者致力于探索黑人游戏的可能性。在视频游戏这个媒介中，可以加入哪些新的充满黑人特色的游戏类型？可以创造哪些新的角色或世界？用 Andrew Benjamin 的话来说，"黑人游戏开发者有话要说！"

这个演示将讨论黑人生活在游戏中的历史，理解游戏中关于BIPOC人群的刻板印象，探讨BIPOC游戏开发者的历史，以及谁正在积极努力解体排斥黑人生活/欢乐的体制。此外，还将探讨关于来自电影中的BIPOC美学，以及如何将其转化为游戏媒介的讨论。

作者：John Cooney  (Game Developer, Wonderful Elephant)

Its been five years since The Flash Games Postmortem and the impact of Flash continues to be critical to our understanding of the modern indie game scene. The indie spirit of Flash games provides many lessons in the modern game space through its developer experiences, accomplishments, preservation, and relationships with platforms. In this talk we explore how Flash's historical impact beyond the "Death of Flash" provides modern lessons to developers and how we can best prepare ourselves for the ephemeral and existential concerns of our industry (and our place in it).

自从《The Flash Games Postmortem》已经过去了五年，Flash 的影响力仍然对我们理解现代独立游戏领域至关重要。Flash 游戏中所体现的独立精神为我们提供了许多关于现代游戏领域的经验教训，包括开发者经历、成就、保存以及与平台的关系。在这次演讲中，我们探讨了Flash 的历史影响如何超越“Flash 的消亡”，为开发者提供现代经验教训，并且如何最好地为我们行业的转瞬即逝和存在的担忧做好准备（以及我们在其中的位置）。

作者：Tanya X. Short  (Captain, Kitfox Games)

Kitfox is in its third year of a 4-day workweek, only 8 hours per day. It's a massively popular policy at the studio, such that 50% of their staff said in a survey that if they had to change jobs, they would need double their salary to return to 5-days per week, and 30% said they "probably could not be persuaded" to return to 5 days at all. Their Captain and co-founder Tanya X. Short steps up to delve into the details of their implementation, in all its snaggy, hiccupy glory. How do you account for federal holidays, or taxes, or contractors, or employee resilience? And the million-dollar question, she'll even dare to answer "Is it as productive?", with as much evidence as she can muster.

Kitfox正在进行每周4天，每天8小时的工作制，这已经是他们的第三个年头。这一政策在工作室非常受欢迎，以至于在一项调查中有50%的员工表示，如果他们不得不换工作，他们需要双倍的薪水来回到每周5天的工作制，30%的员工表示“可能无法说服他们”回到每周5天的工作制。他们的队长兼联合创始人Tanya X. Short挺身而出，深入探讨他们的实施细节，以所有棘手、困难的光辉。如何考虑联邦假日、税收、承包商或员工的反弹力？而那个价值百万美元的问题，她甚至敢于回答“这样是否有效率”，并提供尽可能多的证据。

作者：Chris Zukowski  (Marketing Consultant & Strategist, How To Market A Game)

Best selling, experienced developers, and big publishers have figured out a number of tricks to the Steam Algorithm that allows them to get more visibility on their games. Unfortunately, these tricks are usually only shared among experienced devs or by high-paid consultants. In this talk I will expose these weak points so everyone has a chance to get the most possible visibility for their game.

畅销、经验丰富的开发者和大型发行商已经掌握了一些可以利用 Steam 算法的技巧，让他们的游戏获得更多曝光。不幸的是，这些技巧通常只在经验丰富的开发者之间分享，或者由高薪顾问传授。在这次讲话中，我将揭示这些弱点，让每个人都有机会为他们的游戏获得尽可能多的曝光。
