作者：David Kocan  (Video Game Lawyer, Nixon Peabody, LLP)

The future of game development is AI. Developers have access to an increasing number of different AI tools to assist them in generating a host of elements of games, from art and graphics, music, sound effects, characters, and storylines to actual code, 3d objects, and game maps. But with these new tools comes complicated new IP issues. This session will examine the legal complexities surrounding the ownership of AI-generated game elements, including the potential for disputes over copyright and the implications for player agency in-game elements.

游戏开发的未来是人工智能。开发者们现在可以使用越来越多的不同的人工智能工具来帮助他们生成各种游戏元素，从艺术和图形、音乐、音效、角色和剧情到实际的代码、3D物体和游戏地图。但这些新工具也带来了复杂的知识产权问题。本次会议将探讨与人工智能生成的游戏元素所有权相关的法律复杂性，包括版权纠纷的可能性以及这些元素在游戏中对玩家自主性的影响。

## Beating the Competition: Competitive Intelligence in Gaming

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/beating-the-competition-competitive-intelligence-in-gaming/906733

作者：Aliaksandr Nenadavets  (Director of Market & Competitive Intelligence, SciPlay)

Competitive Intelligence (CI) is surprisingly uncommon in video gaming companies, yet it is crucial for their success. Many studios focus on creative development and technical innovation, often overlooking the strategic advantage that CI can provide. This gap leaves them vulnerable to market shifts and competitor strategies that could significantly impact their profitability and market position. 


CI involves systematically gathering and analyzing information about competitors, market trends, and consumer preferences. In an industry as dynamic and fast-paced as gaming, this intelligence can mean the difference between leading the market and lagging behind. It allows companies to anticipate competitor moves, identify emerging opportunities, and make informed decisions that enhance their competitive edge. 


Despite its importance, CI is underutilized in the gaming sector. Many companies lack dedicated CI teams or rely on ad hoc efforts that fail to capture the full scope of competitive dynamics. This oversight can lead to missed opportunities, strategic missteps, and ultimately, financial losses.

竞争情报（CI）在视频游戏公司中出人意料地不常见，但它对公司的成功至关重要。许多工作室专注于创意开发和技术革新，往往忽视了CI可以提供的战略优势。这种差距使他们容易受到市场变化和竞争对手策略的影响，这些因素可能会显著影响他们的盈利能力和市场地位。

CI 涉及系统地收集和分析有关竞争对手、市场趋势和消费者偏好的信息。在像游戏行业这样动态且快节奏的行业中，这些情报可能意味着领导市场与落后之间的区别。它使公司能够预测竞争对手的动作，识别新兴机会，并做出增强其竞争优势的明智决策。

尽管CI非常重要，但在游戏领域中却未得到充分利用。许多公司缺乏专门的CI团队，或者依赖于零散的努力，这些努力无法全面捕捉竞争动态的全貌。这种疏忽可能导致错失机会、战略失误，最终导致经济损失。

作者：John Buckley  (Communications Director / Publishing Manager, Pocketpair)

Palworld, the breakout hit of 2024, took both the gaming world and its developers, Pocketpair, by surprise. John "Bucky" Buckley found himself managing a massive community of nearly 25 million players, all while facing intense media scrutiny, allegations, and accusations. As a small indie studio with only a few dozen employees, Pocketpair was unprepared for the overwhelming attention Palworld received. They had to act swiftly to prevent the sudden influx of attention from disrupting development and impacting the team's workflow.


In this session, John will share his experience navigating Palworld's launch, detailing how he handled the challenges of overseeing a viral community while protecting the development team from online abuse.

Palworld，这款2024年的爆款游戏，让游戏界乃至其开发商Pocketpair都感到意外。约翰“巴奇”巴克利发现自己在管理一个庞大的近2500万玩家的社区，同时还要面对媒体的严格审查、各种指控和指责。作为一家只有几十名员工的小型独立工作室，Pocketpair完全没有准备好应对Palworld所获得的巨大关注。他们必须迅速采取行动，以防止突如其来的关注扰乱开发进程并影响团队的工作流程。

在本次会议中，约翰将分享他在Palworld发布过程中所经历的经验，详细说明他是如何应对管理病毒式社区的挑战，同时保护开发团队免受网络滥用的侵害。

## Community Management Summit: Oh No! Your Post Reached the Wrong Audience

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/community-management-summit-oh-no-your-post-reached-the-wrong-audience/908359

作者：Bryce Riley  (Associate Social Media Manager, Action Adventure, Electronic Arts)

As community and social media managers, our jobs are a paradox: we want to grow the communities we manage, meaning that we must reach outside our core fanbase and speak to a broader audience. But in doing so, we run the risk of our posts reaching the wrong people, which in turn generates more toxicity – a phenomenon known as Context Collapse. In this lecture, we'll learn a bit more about what Context Collapse is, its effects on social media audiences, and how to mitigate it as we grow our online presence. We'll also dive deeper into solutions used by Dragon Age: The Veilguard, where the social and community teams grew their channels by finding opportunities to create smaller digital spaces.

作为社区和社交媒体管理人员，我们的工作充满矛盾：我们希望扩大我们管理的社区，这意味着我们必须走出我们的核心粉丝群体，与更广泛的受众交流。但这样一来，我们可能会冒着帖子被错误的人看到的风险，进而产生更多的负面行为——这种现象被称为“情境崩溃”。在这次讲座中，我们将更多地了解什么是情境崩溃，它对社交媒体受众的影响，以及如何在扩展我们的在线影响力时减轻这种情况。我们还将深入探讨《龙腾世纪：屏障卫士》（Dragon Age: The Veilguard）团队所采用的解决方案，在这里，社交和社区团队通过寻找机会创建更小的数字空间来扩展他们的渠道。

## Funding Futures Series: Chasing Unicorns: How Venture Funding Really Works

The session will focus on how venture capital funding (broadly) and VC funds (specifically) operate and how they are completely different from publishers and other sources of project funding. We'll explore the logic behind “VC math” and why they primarily invest in GaaS+F2P, and studios that are on a path to scale to unicorn valuations (ie, $1billion). This will also uncover why chasing VCs is usually a waste of time for game developers… as we better understand what they actually look for in a potential deal. We will also examine how things are evolving since the pandemic, particularly at early stages and the need for more evidence.

本次会议将重点关注风险资本融资（广义）和风险投资基金（具体）的运作方式，以及它们与发行商和其他项目资金来源之间的根本区别。我们将探讨“风投数学”的逻辑，以及为什么他们主要投资于GaaS（游戏即服务）+F2P（免费玩）模式，并且是那些有望达到独角兽估值（即，10亿美元）的工作室。这也将揭示为什么游戏开发者通常追逐风投是浪费时间……因为我们会更好地理解他们实际在潜在交易中寻找什么。我们还将审视自疫情以来事情是如何演变的，特别是在早期阶段以及需要更多证据的需求。

## Funding Futures Series: Inception Publishing: The Shift to Indie Self-Publishing

With the sober reality that only a fraction of games that are pitched to publishers actually get signed, this panel will discuss the logic and justification for self-publishing. This includes the need to do marketing at the earliest phases (and what that actually looks like). The session will also explore the various pieces that are needed to make self-publishing work, like dedicated project funds and paid-for publishing services. We'll examine how the landscape is evolving to enable more self-publishing to happen successfully.

鉴于只有少数提交给发行商的游戏最终能够签约的严峻现实，本次圆桌会议将讨论自行发行的逻辑和合理性。这包括在项目初期就需要进行市场推广（并且具体展示这意味着什么）。会议还将探讨实现自行发行所需的各个要素，比如专门的项目资金和付费发行服务。我们将分析行业环境如何演变，以使更多的自行发行能够成功进行。

This panel will explore the evolving role of publishers as the game business landscape continues to shift under our feet. Traditional publishing deals seem harder to score, with more burden to prove market demand placed on developers. Let's dig in on what publishers are looking for today, and how they determine if something actually has a chance to succeed in the market. We'll also examine how business models are evolving, and what other changes are to come in the future. Let's investigate the true value of publishers and how they can best enable developers to prosper.

本场讨论会将探讨随着游戏行业格局持续变化，发行商角色的演变。传统的发行交易似乎越来越难以达成，开发商需要承担更多的证明市场需求的责任。我们将深入探讨当今发行商寻求什么，以及他们如何判断某款产品是否有机会在市场上取得成功。我们还将审视商业模式的演变，以及未来可能出现的其他变革。让我们探究发行商的真实价值，以及他们如何最好地助力开发者繁荣发展。

Applying for indie game jobs can be different than for major studio jobs. The process can be less formal, and the jobs can be more expansive, bleeding into multiple disciplines as every developer may be wearing different hats. It's hard to make a mark as a job-seeker in general, but indie studios are a totally different beast where vibes can be as important as portfolio. Our panel features devs of various types who hire at various levels, who will discuss the best and worst of job applications they've seen while outlining some best practices for the prospective indie game hire.

申请独立游戏工作的过程与大型工作室的工作申请有所不同。这个过程可能不那么正式，而且工作内容可能更加广泛，跨越多个学科，因为每个开发者可能都在扮演不同的角色。总体而言，作为求职者想要脱颖而出已经很困难了，但独立工作室则完全不同，氛围的重要性可能不亚于作品集。我们的小组讨论邀请了不同类型的开发者，他们从各个层面进行招聘，将讨论他们所见过的最佳和最差的求职申请，并概述一些针对潜在独立游戏招聘的最佳实践。

## How Valve Became Valve: An Insider's Account

作者：Monica Harrington  (Founding CMO (retired), Valve)

Valve is now the most successful privately held game company in the world.  How did a tiny startup, dismissed by some industry insiders early on as "a couple of Microsoft developers trying to build a game on top of id's engine" set itself apart?  Monica Harrington was the founding CMO for Valve during a time when her day job included overseeing Games Marketing for Microsoft.  This is her account of Valve's early days--from the initial strategy discussions she had with Valve founders Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington, to the audacious goals she and Gabe set for the launch of Valve's debut game Half-Life, to the early thinking behind Valve's bold platform strategy.  Expect fun anecdotes, behind-the-scenes near-death startup drama, and a bit of reflection - all from the perspective of a woman who played a key role in the industry rocket that became Valve.

Valve 现在是全球最成功的私营游戏公司。那么，一家最初被一些行业内部人士轻视为“几个来自微软的开发者试图基于id软件的引擎来开发游戏”的小公司是如何脱颖而出的呢？莫妮卡·哈林顿在担任 Valve 的创始首席营销官（CMO）期间，她的日常工作还包括负责微软的游戏市场营销。这是她对 Valve 早期日子的叙述——从她与 Valve 创始人加布·纽厄尔和迈克·哈灵顿进行的初始策略讨论，到她和加布为 Valve 首款游戏《半条命》发布设定的雄心勃勃的目标，再到 Valve 大胆平台战略背后的早期思考。预计会有一些有趣的趣闻、幕后惊险的初创公司生死攸关的故事，以及一些反思——所有这些都来自于一位在推动 Valve 成为业界火箭的过程中发挥了关键作用的女性的视角。

## How to Improve Benchmarking Using Steam Tags

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/how-to-improve-benchmarking-using-steam-tags/906897

作者：Stephane Kaufmann  (Data Director, PulluP Entertainment)

On Steam, user-generated tags offer valuable information about games and market trends. When doing benchmarking on Steam games, one can use tags to investigate whether a niche market is too crowded, whether games with a specific tag are generally successful or not, and so on. However, we present in this talk issues that arise when using Steam tags straightforwardly in analyses, and we provide a method to overcome them. In particular, we take the example of and MIO: Memories in Orbit, published by Focus Entertainment. The examples will showcase how we can get actionable insights and make better strategic decisions by investigating deeper than just looking at which games have certain tags.

在Steam上，用户生成的标签提供了关于游戏和市场趋势的有价值信息。在对Steam游戏进行基准测试时，可以使用这些标签来研究某个细分市场是否过于拥挤，带有特定标签的游戏是否普遍成功等问题。然而，在本次演讲中，我们将提出在直接使用Steam标签进行分析时出现的问题，并提供一种克服这些问题的方法。特别地，我们以Focus Entertainment出版的《MIO：轨道记忆》为例。这些例子将展示我们如何通过深入研究不仅仅是查看哪些游戏具有某些标签，从而获得可操作的见解并做出更好的战略决策。

## Improving Live Service Monetization Through Player Telemetry Enabled Marketing

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/improving-live-service-monetization-through-player-telemetry-enabled-marketing/907237

作者：Richard Goldsmith  (Senior Manager, Deloitte Consulting)

Tying player telemetry and past in-game purchases to a dynamic offer system is a rare step in the industry, despite its proven impact on monetization rates and average player spend, as well as player satisfaction. After all, expecting players to dig through in-game marketplaces for preferred products when every other digital commerce experience has trained them to expect personalized and dynamic offers is, at best, a backwards way of thinking (and at-worst, self-sabotage). Especially given that personalized offers, on average, result in 10-15% increased revenue, reduce marketing costs by up to 20%, and one major franchise that implemented a system like this drove a > $5M increase in monthly player spend. During this session we'll explore the potential of personalized offers in in-game marketplaces, discuss why this isn't standard operating procedure, and provide reference architecture, technology, and tips that can immediately be applied and used in attendees' own projects.

将玩家遥测数据和过去的游戏中购买内容与动态优惠系统相结合，在业内是一个罕见的步骤，尽管它已被证明对提高变现率、平均玩家消费以及玩家满意度有显著影响。毕竟，当其他所有数字商业体验都已经教会玩家期望个性化和动态的优惠时，还指望玩家在游戏商城中翻找他们喜欢的产品，这至少是一种反向思维（甚至可能是自毁行为）。特别是考虑到个性化优惠平均能带来10-15%的收入增长，减少高达20%的营销成本，并且有一个主要的游戏系列实施了类似的系统，导致每月玩家消费增加了>500万美元。在本次会议中，我们将探讨游戏中商城内个性化优惠的潜力，讨论为什么这不是标准操作程序，并提供可以立即应用到参会者自己项目的参考架构、技术和建议。

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/serving-players-needs-a-new-look-at-what-players-want/907205

作者：Andrew Pappas  (Marketing Consultant, RenGen Marketing)

Game creators often struggle to stand out in a competitive market, but the challenge goes beyond market saturation or discoverability issues.


The root of the problem lies in how we oversimplify players, reducing them to their in-game characteristics.


Tackling what we think we know about game markets and audiences, we break down the process and examine how we apply market and audience information. By using a framework that focuses on a more empathetic approach, new methods and strategies reveal how game creators can identify missed opportunities in any market by addressing players' broader needs.


Discover processes that identify valuable insights that go beyond player's gaming behaviors and preferences. Learn how to apply them so you can make more meaningful decisions in development and marketing efforts while creating experiences that are fulfilling for both you and your players.

游戏创作者往往难以在竞争激烈的市场中脱颖而出，但挑战不仅仅在于市场饱和或发现难题。

问题的根本在于我们如何过度简化玩家，将他们仅归结为他们在游戏中的特征。

通过探讨我们认为我们知道的游戏市场和受众，我们将这一过程分解并检查我们如何应用市场和受众信息。通过采用一种更注重同理心的方法框架，新的方法和策略揭示了游戏创作者如何通过满足玩家的更广泛需求，在任何市场中识别被错过的机遇。

发现能够识别超越玩家游戏行为和偏好的有价值见解的过程。学习如何应用这些见解，以便在开发和营销过程中做出更有意义的决策，同时创造既对你自己也对玩家有意义的体验。

Everyone’s a fan of something, and finding ways to connect over shared love – or shared hate – is a tale as old as time. But what happens when the thing a bunch of people are loving, hating, and talking about is… your game?Using Episode, a mobile storytelling platform, as a case study, this session will work to provide a look at developing and maintaining a successful game with an active fandom.This talk dives deep into modern fandoms, including why they're worth fostering and respecting and how a healthy fandom can be a product resource for your game. Beginning with an overview of what fandoms are and how they function, the session explores strategies for productive engagement and the impact fandoms can have on games.

每个人都有自己的兴趣所在，而找到方法通过共同的喜爱——或共同的厌恶——来建立联系，这是一个古老的故事。但当大量人们热爱、讨厌并讨论的事物是……你的游戏时，会发生什么呢？  
 
以Episode（一款移动故事平台）作为案例研究，本次会议将致力于提供关于如何开发和维护一款拥有活跃粉丝群体的成功游戏的见解。  
 
本演讲深入探讨现代粉丝文化，包括为什么这些粉丝文化值得培养和尊重，以及一个健康的粉丝群体如何成为你游戏的产品资源。从概述粉丝群体是什么以及它们如何运作开始，会议将探索有效的参与策略以及粉丝群体对游戏可能产生的影响。

Layoffs are the bane of the game industry. And while some studios lay off developers frequently, some studios have managed to avoid that painful and drastic step. How do they do it? Is it just luck, or is there more to it than that? In this roundtable, developers who have been on teams that have found ways to avoid layoffs are invited to tell the stories of how they managed this rare feat. The roundtable will be led by Jesse Schell, CEO of Schell Games, a team of over 150 developers that has had zero layoffs in its 22 year history. Abstract griping about the game industry is strictly forbidden at this session – real world tales that show stability is possible are the coin of the realm here.

## Using ARGs to Communicate What Makes 'Animal Well' Special

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/using-args-to-communicate-what-makes-animal-well-special/907870

作者：Dan Adelman  (Business and Marketing, Shared Memory)

Animal Well is a tricky game to market. Its screenshots may not look particularly impressive, nor even do short video clips. One of the things that makes Animal Well special is the secrets hidden throughout the world, but it was proving very difficult to communicate the feeling of uncovering secrets within the game without ruining them. We decided to demonstrate this feeling through the use of ARGs in which we buried puzzles within trailers and blog posts. This strategy was very effective in communicating what's special about the game while also giving our community something fun to engage with in exchange for their attention. But there was also a bit of a dark side. We noticed some people in our community chasing after shadows in ways we worried may not be healthy. We'll discuss how we approached this and some advice for others considering a similar strategy.

《动物之井》是一款难以推广的游戏。它的截图可能看起来并不特别令人印象深刻，即使是短视频片段也是如此。《动物之井》的独特之处之一在于游戏中隐藏的秘密，但证明很难在不破坏这些秘密的情况下传达在游戏中发现秘密的感觉。我们决定通过使用ARG（ Alternate Reality Game，交替现实游戏）来展示这种感觉，我们在预告片和博客文章中埋下了谜题。这一策略非常有效地传达了游戏的独特之处，同时也为我们社区提供了一些有趣的内容，以换取他们的关注。但也有一定的负面影响。我们注意到社区中的一些人以一种我们担心可能不健康的方式追逐幻影。我们将讨论我们是如何应对这种情况的，并为那些考虑采用类似策略的人提供一些建议。

## What Publishing a Book Taught Me About Publishing Video Games

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/what-publishing-a-book-taught-me-about-publishing-video-games/907268

作者：Karah Sutton  (Chief Publishing Officer, PikPok)

In 2020, PikPok's Chief Publishing Officer Karah Sutton became a published author, with her first book published by Penguin Random House. This journey led to Sutton reassessing the role of the publisher in video games and finding a new appreciation for the tools available to today's video game makers. In recent decades, both books and video games have shifted from a business model that's wholly dependent on 3rd party publishers. We are now indie creatives empowered to self-publish. Yet, self-publishing demands market awareness and marketing savvy. What can game devs learn from the mistakes and successes of the world of book publishing?

2020年，PikPok的首席出版官Karah Sutton成为了一位已出版的作者，她的第一本书由企鹅兰登书屋出版。这一旅程促使Sutton重新评估了视频游戏出版商的角色，并发现了对当今视频游戏制作者可用工具的新认识。在最近几十年里，书籍和视频游戏都已经从完全依赖第三方出版商的商业模式转变过来。我们现在是独立创作者，能够自行发布作品。然而，自行发布需要对市场有敏锐的洞察力和营销智慧。游戏开发者能从图书出版领域的成功与失败中学到什么呢？
