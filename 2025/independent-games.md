作者：Levi Pinkert  (Lead Designer, The WereCleaner, The WereCleaner)、Cameron Gomez  (Lead Engineer, The WereCleaner, The WereCleaner)

From student project to indie success, The WereCleaner was brought to life in just one year. In this session, hear from the game's lead engineer and lead designer about using Unity to implement the game's distinctive core loop – a combination of violent stealth and laidback cleaning. They'll describe the system that generates messes by splattering the blood of innocent NPCs across the environment and the inner workings of the game's satisfying cleaning mechanics.

从学生项目到独立游戏的成功，《The WereCleaner》仅用一年时间就得以面世。在这次分享中，我们将听到游戏的主要工程师和主设计师讲述如何使用Unity来实现游戏独特的核心循环——暴力潜行与轻松清洁的结合。他们将描述一种系统，该系统通过将无辜NPC的血液溅洒在环境中来生成混乱，并详细介绍游戏中令人满意的清洁机制的内部运作。

## Independent Games Summit: 'Bird': Developing a Game from Both Sides of a Prison Wall

作者：Spencer Bambrick  (Composer/Designer, A Sole Proprietorship)

This session will be a deep dive into the design, development, and social impact of Bird, an interactive documentary about mass incarceration in the U.S. Bird was developed in collaboration with artist and activist Darrell Fair, who has served thirty years of a fifty year sentence in StatevilleCorrectional. Bird features hand-drawn artwork and recorded interviews of Darrell and his family, presented as “artifacts” (or memories) that players interact with. These artifacts pull players into the story of his arrest, coerced confession, his treatment in prison and its impact on his loved ones. Attendees will walk away with an inspirational look at the unique and moving development of Bird, practical advice on developing an experimental game design practice, and an understanding of the power that interactive storytelling has to make a lasting impact on players.

本次会议将深入探讨《Bird》的设计、开发及其在美国大规模监禁这一社会议题上的影响。《Bird》是由艺术家兼活动家达雷尔·费尔与开发团队合作完成的，他因在州立农场矫正中心服刑五十年中的三十年而深有体会。《Bird》采用了手绘艺术作品和对达雷尔及其家人的录音访谈，这些内容以“文物”（或记忆）的形式呈现，供玩家互动。这些文物将玩家引入到他的被捕经历、被迫认罪、监狱中的待遇以及这些事件对其亲人的影响的故事中。参会者将从这次会议中获得关于《Bird》独特且感人的开发过程的启发，获取关于如何开发实验性游戏设计实践的实用建议，并理解交互式叙事如何能够对玩家产生持久的影响。

## Independent Games Summit: 'The Crush House': Fresh Gameplay Inspired By The Real World

作者：Nicole He  (Creative Director, Independent)

Stories in video games are often based on the real world. But what about ~mechanics~ in video games being based on The Real World? The Crush House is a game about being the producer of a reality TV show. It's not quite a management sim, or a visual novel, or a first-person shooter - in fact, it is a "thirst-person shooter," where you film things to satisfy audiences while uncovering a mystery. Rather than following the conventional path of taking a tried-and-true genre and mechanic and adding a twist on top, The Crush House's unusual gameplay comes from iterating on capturing a specific fantasy from real life - being behind the scenes of a reality show. Nicole He, the game's creative director, will talk about the challenges and rewards of making innovative gameplay by looking for inspiration from outside of familiar game design formulas.

视频游戏中经常采用现实世界的故事。但视频游戏中的~机制~能否基于真实世界呢？《The Crush House》是一款关于成为一档真人秀节目的制作人的游戏。它不仅仅是一款管理模拟游戏、视觉小说或第一人称射击游戏——实际上，它是一款“渴求人称射击”游戏，在这里你需要拍摄各种事物来满足观众的需求，同时揭开一个谜团。与遵循传统的做法不同，即在已有的成熟类型和机制上添加一些创新元素，《The Crush House》独特的游戏玩法来自于对捕捉现实生活中的特定幻想进行迭代——置身于真人秀节目幕后。该作的创意总监妮可·何（Nicole He）将讨论通过从熟悉的游戏设计公式之外寻找灵感来创造创新游戏体验所面临的挑战和收获。

## Independent Games Summit: Comedy Through Patterns (How to Structure a Funny Video Game)

作者：Tanat Boozayaangool  (Independent Game Developer, Tan Ant Games)

Have you ever wondered what makes a video game funny? (Spoiler: it's not puns).In this talk, the developer behind Building Relationships dissects humor through an analytical lens to explain comedy fundamentals and demonstrate how they're applied throughout the game. The speaker argues that comedy doesn't just come from writing, but also from the structure it exists in. The talk examines the approach behind Building Relationships and presents case studies of other games to explore how comedy is supported by various disciplines (i.e. level design, music, narrative design, etc.).Building Relationships is a silly adventure game where players take the role of a house that's on a date with a building. Described as "A Short Hike, but stupid", this game is a barrage of absurdist comedy fueled by improv sensibilities. Hidden behind its comedic facade, the game conveys a heartfelt story about what it takes to stay alive.

你是否曾好奇是什么让电子游戏变得有趣？（提示：不仅仅是文字游戏）。在这次演讲中，开发了《建立关系》这款游戏的开发者将通过分析的方法来解构幽默，解释喜剧的基本原理，并展示它们在游戏中是如何应用的。演讲者认为，喜剧不仅来源于写作，还来源于它所存在的结构。本次演讲将审视《建立关系》背后的设计思路，并通过其他游戏的案例研究，探讨不同学科（如关卡设计、音乐、叙事设计等）如何支持喜剧效果。

《建立关系》是一款充满欢笑的冒险游戏，在这款游戏中玩家将扮演一栋房子，这栋房子正在与另一栋建筑约会。这款游戏被描述为“一个简短的攀登，但很愚蠢”，其核心是充满荒诞幽默的游戏内容，这些幽默感源于即兴创作的理念。尽管游戏表面充满了喜剧元素，但它也讲述了一个关于生存的故事，传递出一种真挚的情感。

作者：Matt Hackett  (Game Developer, Valadria)

Making great games isn’t enough anymore. For our games to be successful, we also need to spread the word about them. In 2025 that means creating content, especially for online stores and social media platforms.To do this, we need loads of screenshots and video!This talk discusses making changes directly to your game to ease this process. We’ll rapidly load up the exact content you need to capture, and make tools to generate screenshots from within your game. We’ll cover screenshot best practices (like when to show or hide UI elements) and videos too (like muting music but playing sound effects).This process should be streamlined, so that we stay in the flow of work, retaining concentration and productivity. By the end of this talk you’ll be empowered to quickly generate any content you need, in any format or resolution. Let’s make screenshots and video easy to capture!

制作出色的游戏已经不够了。为了让我们的游戏获得成功，我们还需要宣传它们。到2025年，这意味着要为在线商店和社交媒体平台创造内容。为此，我们需要大量的截图和视频！这次演讲将讨论如何直接对游戏进行修改，以简化这一过程。我们将快速加载你需要捕获的确切内容，并在游戏中制作工具来自动生成截图。我们将涵盖截图的最佳实践（如何时显示或隐藏UI元素）以及视频方面的最佳实践（如静音音乐但播放音效）。这个过程应该被优化，以便我们保持工作的流畅性，保持专注和提高生产力。通过这次演讲，你将有能力快速生成任何你需要的内容，无论是哪种格式或分辨率。让我们使截图和视频的捕捉变得简单易行！

作者：Walt Destler  (CEO, Walternate Realities)

In October 2022, "Cosmoteer: Starship Architect & Commander" launched on Steam Early Access and became an instant indie hit, selling nearly 200k units in its first month and over 450k units to date. But that success didn't come out of nowhere; it was the clear result of the unusual decision to let the world play Cosmoteer for free during most of its development. This talk will explain why that decision was made, the results of that decision, this strategy's general pros and cons, and why many game developers should consider doing the same.

2022年10月，“Cosmoteer: Starship Architect & Commander”在Steam抢先体验阶段发布，并迅速成为独立游戏的热门作品，在第一个月内售出了近20万份，至今已售出超过45万份。但这一成功并非偶然；它是早期决定在大部分开发期间让玩家免费游玩Cosmoteer这一不寻常决策的直接结果。本次演讲将解释为何做出这一决定、该决策的结果、这一策略的一般优缺点，以及为什么许多游戏开发者应该考虑采取类似的策略。

A well-designed gameplay system is essential to creating an engaging experience, and even minor adjustments can lead to significant improvements. However, for many first-time indie game developers, system design can seem daunting and complex. It is commonly seen as "the overwhelming part of design" and is often overlooked until it is too late. 

In this talk, we bring together a diverse group of game designers with varying levels of experience to share their insights in a series of microtalks. Our aim is to demystify the role of system designers and showcase how the role exists within games with different scope from solo dev projects to III indie. 

We will give a big-picture overview of what systemic design is, with specific examples such as combat mechanics, fire propagation, and more!

一个设计良好的游戏系统对于创造令人沉浸的游戏体验至关重要，即使是微小的调整也可能带来显著的改进。然而，对于许多初次尝试的独立游戏开发者来说，系统设计似乎既令人生畏又复杂。它通常被视为“设计中最繁重的部分”，并且往往直到为时已晚才被重视。

在本次讨论中，我们将汇集一群具有不同经验水平的游戏设计师，通过一系列微型演讲分享他们的见解。我们的目标是揭开系统设计师角色的神秘面纱，并展示这一角色如何存在于从个人开发者项目到大型独立游戏的各种规模游戏中。

我们将概述系统设计的大致内容，并通过具体的例子如战斗机制、火焰传播等进行说明！

作者：Jenny Windom  (Communications Director, Ivy Road)、Dana Trebella  (Founder, Spoke & Wheel Strategy)

With renowned, long-term game media outlets like Waypoint and Game Informer shuttering over the past year, and the proliferation of influencers in the space, studios and publishers need to adjust their marketing strategies to fit the ever-changing media environment. 


This rapidly changing landscape has led to misconceptions ("If this streamer plays my game, I'll get this many sales!") and challenges in determining the strongest ways to maximize the impact of outreach, assets, and announcements. In this talk, Dana and Jenny will combine their years of experience working in marketing, content creation, brand strategy, and PR to detail how studios and publishers can make sense of what's available to them. They'll first do this by sharing strategies for running a competitive analysis, then model how teams can use that information to determine the best timing, audience, and outreach for traditional media and influencers, creating impactful activations for their title's marketing lifecycle.

随着知名的游戏媒体机构如Waypoint和Game Informer在过去一年的关闭，以及影响力人物在这一领域的增多，工作室和发行商需要调整其营销策略以适应不断变化的媒体环境。

这个快速变化的格局导致了一些误解（“如果这位主播玩我的游戏，我就能获得这么多销量！”）和挑战，即如何确定最有效的方法来最大化推广、资产和公告的影响。在这次演讲中，Dana和Jenny将结合他们在市场营销、内容创作、品牌战略和公关方面的多年经验，详细说明工作室和发行商如何理解他们可用的各种资源。他们首先会分享进行竞争分析的战略，然后展示团队如何利用这些信息来确定传统媒体和影响力人物的最佳时机、受众和推广方式，从而为游戏的市场生命周期创造有影响力的活动。

作者：Michelle Olson  (Mission Designer, Lightspeed LA)

Creative meetings are wonderful yet delicate things - they can be exhilarating… but if not run with intention, can become exasperating. Sometimes a single voice dominates the room. Sometimes no one feels empowered to speak. Worst of all, a poorly run design meeting can make attendees feel like it was all a waste of time. With indie development, every minute is precious - What can we do to consistently boost the energy, productivity, and magic of these meetings? How can we get the most out of our designers and foster an environment of creativity, camaraderie, and focus? In this talk, game designer and former game director Michelle Olson will introduce and discuss the importance of psychological safety, and how meeting structure, communication style, and a whole lot of empathy can assist with making your meetings energizing, efficient, and empowering.

创意会议是美妙而微妙的事情——它们可以令人振奋……但如果缺乏明确的目的性，就会变得令人沮丧。有时一个声音会主导整个房间。有时又没有人觉得自己有足够的权力发言。最糟糕的是，一场组织不当的设计会议可能会让与会者觉得这完全是在浪费时间。对于独立游戏开发来说，每一分钟都弥足珍贵——我们能做些什么来持续提升这些会议的能量、生产力和魔力呢？我们如何才能最大限度地发挥设计师的作用，并营造一种充满创造力、友谊和专注的环境？在这次演讲中，游戏设计师兼前游戏总监米歇尔·奥尔森将介绍并讨论心理安全感的重要性，以及会议结构、沟通方式和大量的同理心如何能够帮助使会议充满活力、高效且具有赋能性。

Every game has a different struggle to face when it comes to live development, inviting players to participate in the evolution of a concept from a seedling to a full-fledged product. However, even if we limit the conversation by genre and platform (sandbox simulations on Steam), we can still see different teams use different methods and philosophies to pursue their goals and grow their game. Some tiptoe stealthily into Early Access, some launch into it with a bang, some bypass Early Access altogether. Some save up giant patches for years and others patch weekly. Four different teams will share their approach and the pros and cons they've observed in their results.

每款游戏在直播开发过程中都面临着不同的挑战，邀请玩家参与到从萌芽到成熟产品的概念进化中。然而，即使我们将讨论限制在特定的类型和平台（如Steam上的沙盒模拟游戏）内，我们仍然可以看到不同的团队使用不同的方法和理念来追求他们的目标并发展他们的游戏。有些团队小心翼翼地悄悄进入抢先体验阶段，有些则以轰动的方式进入，有些则完全绕过了抢先体验阶段。有些团队积攒大型更新补丁多年才发布，而有些则是每周进行更新。四个不同的团队将分享他们各自的方法以及他们在结果中观察到的优点和缺点。
