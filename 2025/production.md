作者：Joshua Koen  (Manager, User Research, Blizzard Entertainment)、Ian Livingston  (Director, User Research, Blizzard Entertainment)

Our players dedicate tens, hundreds, or even thousands of hours to the experiences that we craft for them. Players have valuable feedback about how we can improve those experiences, but it can be challenging for developers to quickly parse vast amounts of feedback and identify ways to improve experiences. The presenters will explore the benefits and risks of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for analyzing player feedback. LLMs offer a way to efficiently analyze feedback at depth and scale that has not been previously possible. However, there are dangers of producing incorrect outcomes that are easy to overlook without a careful approach. Prompt structure, game terminology, and data complexity can easily trip up LLMs. The session will present ways that Blizzard has been validating the use of LLMs for this type of analysis. We will illustrate workflows for using LLMs to enhance processes for analyzing feedback from players.

我们的玩家投入数十、数百甚至数千小时来体验我们为他们打造的游戏内容。玩家对于如何改进这些体验有着宝贵的反馈意见，但对于开发者来说，快速解析大量的反馈并找出改进的方法可能会颇具挑战性。演讲者将探讨使用大型语言模型（LLMs）分析玩家反馈的好处和风险。LLMs提供了一种高效且以前无法实现的深度和规模的反馈分析方式。然而，在没有仔细处理的情况下，很容易忽视可能导致错误结果的危险。提示结构、游戏术语和数据复杂性都可能使LLMs陷入困境。本次会议将展示暴雪公司验证使用LLMs进行此类分析的方法。我们将展示如何利用LLMs增强分析玩家反馈的过程。

## 'Avowed' Branching Narratives: Shifting from QA Testing to Analyzing

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/avowed-branching-narratives-shifting-from-qa-testing-to-analyzing/907172

作者：David Benefield  (QA Lead, Obsidian Entertainment)

The Quality Assurance department at Obsidian have taken great strides in shifting the perception and use case of QA Analysts on Avowed from being 'testers' who spend the majority of their work hours playing the game and reporting obvious bugs, to being 'analysts' who spend most of their time outside the game client to find, correct, and prevent defects.


This talk focuses on how QA put this philosophy into practice for Quests in Avowed. Attendees will see each step leading up to the 'Joint Analysis Sessions' that leveraged Area Designer and Quality Assurance Analysts to fix bugs before they were even reported.

Obsidian 的质量保证部门在转变《Avowed》中质量保证分析师的角色认知方面取得了显著进展，从被视为主要通过玩游戏和报告显而易见的漏洞的“测试者”，转变为更多地在游戏客户端外部工作的“分析师”，以发现、纠正和预防缺陷。

本次演讲重点介绍了质量保证团队如何在《Avowed》的任务系统中实践这一理念。与会者将看到从开始到“联合分析会议”的每一步骤，这些会议利用区域设计师和质量保证分析师在问题被报告之前就修复漏洞。

作者：Adam Russell  (Lead Designer, Studio Gobo)

If you break down everything that goes into making a game, and improve each thing by just one percent, you'll have a significant improvement when you put them all together.


This talk from Studio Gobo's Lead Designer Adam Russell will go into detail about how to build marginal gains into your team's development process, and create a mindset that empowers individual team members to identify and action micro-improvements that, when combined, compound to create improvements that benefit everyone all the way from our dev team to our players.


Using examples from LEGO Horizon Adventures, Adam will discuss how marginal gains has become a development mantra at Studio Gobo. Including how to build this into your teams at a process and features level, the benefits of doing this all the way through development, and how to overcome some of the challenges you may face.

如果你将制作游戏所需的一切拆解开来，并且在每一方面都提高百分之一，那么当你把这些提升综合在一起时，就会取得显著的进步。

Studio Gobo首席设计师亚当·拉塞尔的演讲将详细探讨如何在团队的开发过程中构建微小的优势，并培养一种心态，使团队成员能够识别并实施微小改进，而这些改进累积起来会形成从开发团队到玩家都能受益的提升。

通过《乐高无限冒险》的例子，亚当将讨论微小优势如何成为Studio Gobo的开发信条。包括如何在流程和功能层面将这一点融入你的团队，这样做从头到尾进行开发的好处，以及如何克服可能遇到的一些挑战。

The session will focus on how venture capital funding (broadly) and VC funds (specifically) operate and how they are completely different from publishers and other sources of project funding. We'll explore the logic behind “VC math” and why they primarily invest in GaaS+F2P, and studios that are on a path to scale to unicorn valuations (ie, $1billion). This will also uncover why chasing VCs is usually a waste of time for game developers… as we better understand what they actually look for in a potential deal. We will also examine how things are evolving since the pandemic, particularly at early stages and the need for more evidence.

本次会议将重点关注风险资本融资（广义）和风险投资基金（具体）的运作方式，以及它们与发行商和其他项目资金来源之间的根本区别。我们将探讨“风投数学”的逻辑，以及为什么他们主要投资于GaaS（游戏即服务）+F2P（免费玩）模式，并且关注那些有望达到独角兽估值（即10亿美元）的工作室。这也将揭示为什么游戏开发者追逐风投通常是一种时间浪费……随着我们更好地理解风投在潜在交易中实际寻求的内容。我们还将分析自疫情以来情况如何演变，特别是在早期阶段以及需要更多证据的需求。

作者：Seb Long  (Managing Director, Player Research)

The role of player feedback in game development can be divisive and complex. Some studios totally embrace players' engagement in design through early access, open development, routine user research, and community engagement. Other studios limit player feedback to just post-launch, or perhaps dismiss feedback completely.How can teams use the 'voice of the player' rationally, effectively and deliberately?Are there challenges you face that player feedback could overcome?Can you make a greater success of the feedback you already have?How does the 'voice' of player data change through development?These three roundtables present a valuable opportunity to surface your challenges, viewpoints and experience on the use of player feedback to inform game design. Learn from the experiences of fellow designers, researchers, data scientists, community and player champions, and take away new ideas and perspectives on the value of players' voice in design decision-making.

玩家反馈在游戏开发中的作用可能具有争议且复杂。一些工作室通过抢先体验、开放开发、常规用户研究和社区参与等方式完全接纳玩家在设计中的参与。而其他工作室则仅将玩家反馈限制在游戏发布后，或者甚至完全忽略反馈。团队如何理性、有效地并有目的地利用“玩家的声音”？你面临的问题中有哪些是玩家反馈可以帮助克服的？你能更成功地利用你已经拥有的反馈吗？在开发过程中，“玩家数据的声音”是如何变化的？这三个圆桌会议提供了宝贵的契机，让你能够提出你在使用玩家反馈指导游戏设计时所面临的挑战、观点和经验。从同行设计师、研究人员、数据科学家、社区和玩家大使的经验中学习，并带走关于玩家声音在设计决策中价值的新想法和新视角。

Some studios totally embrace players' engagement in design through early access, open development, routine user research, and community engagement. Other studios limit player feedback to just post-launch, or perhaps dismiss feedback completely.


How can teams use the 'voice of the player' rationally, effectively and deliberately?


Are there challenges you face that player feedback could overcome?


Can you make a greater success of the feedback you already have?


How does the 'voice' of player data change through development?


These three roundtables present a valuable opportunity to surface your challenges, viewpoints and experience on the use of player feedback to inform game design. Learn from the experiences of fellow designers, researchers, data scientists, community and player champions, and take away new ideas and perspectives on the value of players' voice in design decision-making.

玩家反馈在游戏开发中的作用可能具有争议性和复杂性。一些工作室通过早期访问、开放开发、常规用户研究和社区参与等方式完全接纳玩家在设计中的参与。而其他工作室则仅将玩家反馈限制在游戏发布后，甚至可能完全忽略反馈。

团队如何理性、有效地且有目的地利用“玩家的声音”？

你面临哪些挑战可以通过玩家反馈来克服？

你能更成功地利用已有的反馈吗？

玩家数据的“声音”在整个开发过程中是如何变化的？

这三个圆桌会议提供了宝贵的机会，让你提出关于使用玩家反馈来指导游戏设计的挑战、观点和经验。从同行设计师、研究人员、数据科学家、社区和玩家倡导者的经验中学习，并带走关于玩家声音在设计决策中价值的新想法和视角。

## Multiclassing: Switching from Lead Designer to Executive Producer

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/multiclassing-switching-from-lead-designer-to-executive-producer/907325

作者：Brett Norton  (Executive Producer, Oxide Interactive)

Transitioning from a Design role to a Production role can be tough, especially when it's at one of the highest levels of team operations. Where should your focus be? How much time is spent on your internal operations vs. external operations? When you can focus on anything, the challenge becomes focusing on the best thing for the project and team.In this presentation, we'll explore the transition into a leading production role, the responsibilities of the new job, and most importantly, how those responsibilities change over the course of years as the team changes. This will be an honest look at stark realities that producers often have to deal with, such as staff resigning, shifting project goals, and other circumstances beyond your direct control.

从设计角色转型到制作角色可能颇具挑战性，尤其是在团队运营的最高级别。你的关注点应该放在哪里？你应该花多少时间在内部运营和外部运营上？当你能够专注于任何事情时，挑战就变成了专注于对项目和团队最有利的事情。在本次演讲中，我们将探讨进入领导级制作角色的过渡过程、新职位的责任，以及最重要的是，随着团队的变化，这些责任如何随着时间的推移而变化。这将是一次坦诚地审视制作人通常不得不处理的严酷现实的机会，比如员工辞职、项目目标变动以及其他超出你直接控制范围的情况。

## Process Lite: Less Time on Process, More Time on Development

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/process-lite-less-time-on-process-more-time-on-development/907839

作者：Anna Nguyen  (Senior Producer, Blind Squirrel Games)

There is a delicate balance to how much process helps development run smoothly and it feeling like processes are getting in the way of the work itself. This talk is about advice and actionable steps for teams that are feeling overburdened by process and producers feeling overwhelmed with the time commitments needed to maintain those processes. How to avoid falling into the trap of adding more heavy-handed and time-consuming processes to "fix" development workflows. Discuss how to have the conversations on scaling back on the level of process.Delve into what the right ratio of producers for a project is and how that ratio needs to scale based on a number of factors including the layers of process being usedFinding the right balance of process for your team, what areas to really focus on, and how much bandwidth is needed to maintain those processes.

过程的多少如何才能既有助于开发顺畅进行，又不至于让流程本身成为工作的障碍，这是一个微妙的平衡。本次演讲将为那些因流程而感到负担过重的团队以及那些因维护这些流程所需的时间承诺而感到不堪重负的制作人提供一些实用建议和步骤。讨论如何避免陷入增加更多繁琐且耗时的流程以“改进”开发工作流程的陷阱。探讨如何就减少流程级别进行对话。深入探讨一个项目所需的制作人比例及其根据多种因素（包括所使用的流程层次）需要如何进行调整。找到适合您团队的最佳流程平衡点，重点关注哪些领域，以及维持这些流程需要多少资源。

## Production Traps: How Producers and Leaders Get Stuck

作者：Benjamin Carcich  (CEO/Founder, Valarin, Inc., Building Better Games)

In this talk, Ben identifies the traps that keep producers from being as effective as they could be. He also explains how to escape these “production traps” and what producers and leaders should be doing instead.We are solving the wrong problems in game dev. While our teams struggle with morale, face unrealistic expectations, and have little connection to the vision of the game, too often producers are tweaking the team's process and making sure to send the sprint report on time.We can have a much larger positive impact. It's time to reframe our role as producers and leaders and start helping our teams build better games.

在这次演讲中，本指出了阻碍制作人发挥最大效能的陷阱。他还解释了如何摆脱这些“生产陷阱”，以及制作人和领导者应该做些什么。我们在游戏开发中解决的是错误的问题。当我们的团队在士气上挣扎、面临不切实际的期望，并且与游戏愿景几乎没有联系时，制作人往往在调整团队的工作流程并确保按时发送冲刺报告。我们可以产生更大的积极影响。是时候重新定义我们作为制作人和领导者的角色，开始帮助团队制作更好的游戏。

作者：Francesco Galletti  (Senior Software Engineer, Raven Software)、Karl Beauregard  (Assistant Creative Director, Beenox)

Retaining players in a live service game isn't just about adding content, but also about improving existing features by addressing player feedback and generating positive community sentiment. With hundreds of thousands of monthly mentions on social channels and millions of active players, Call of Duty: Warzone faces this challenge globally. To navigate this, the team developed the LISTEN pipeline, a six-step process to identify critical feedback and implement strategic Quality of Life improvements. Attendees gain expert insight on how to leverage sentiment data, engage domain experts, and garner internal support to scale implementation of this pipeline across projects, teams, or even studios. Lessons learned throughout years of development make this talk valuable for game developers and team leaders looking for a framework to enhance their live service practices.

保留活服务游戏中的玩家不仅仅在于添加内容，还在于通过解决玩家反馈来改进现有功能，并产生积极的社区情绪。《使命召唤：战区》在全球范围内每月在社交媒体渠道上有数十万次提及，拥有数百万活跃玩家，面临着这一挑战。为应对这一挑战，团队开发了LISTEN管道，这是一种六步流程，用于识别关键反馈并实施战略性的生活质量改进。与会者可以获得如何利用情感数据、吸引领域专家以及获得内部支持以在各个项目、团队甚至工作室中扩展此管道实施的专业见解。多年来积累的经验教训使这次演讲对于寻求增强其活服务实践框架的游戏开发者和团队领导非常有价值。

## The Game Maker's Zodiac: A Team-Building Tool

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/the-game-makers-zodiac-a-team-building-tool/907262

作者：Isaque Sanches  (Senior Game Designer, Ubisoft)

Folks in the games industry want to make games for many reasons: not everyone is motivated by the same things.


This lecture takes a look at different types of creators in the industry: not only by job family (code, design, art, audio, production, etc) but by grouping them by personality traits, backgrounds, aesthetic preferences and biases.


From there, a general high-level breakdown is presented: the lecturer proposes 13 archetypes for videogame creators, based on research (cross-referencing literature and collected data), and invites you to explore how these might communicate with one another, what are the strengths and weaknesses of each archetype grouping, and how they can all work in harmony by co-empowering each other.

游戏行业中的人都想出于各种原因制作游戏：并非每个人被同样的东西所激励。

本讲座探讨了行业内不同类型的创作者：不仅按职业类别（编程、设计、美术、音频、制作等）划分，还通过个性特征、背景、审美偏好和偏见对他们进行分组。

在此基础上，提出了一个大致的高层次分类：讲师基于研究（交叉引用文献和收集的数据）提出了13种电子游戏创作者的原型，并邀请您探索这些原型之间如何沟通交流，每种原型群体的优势和劣势是什么，以及他们如何通过互相赋能而和谐共事。

In this talk, Colin Walder and Marta Wozniak describe the role that core values play in building organizational health and why it is vital that managers and executives pay attention to them. When given proper attention, they can be the glue that holds your teams together, even as they grow. When ignored and left untended, they can pull your teams apart. Colin and Marta describe the different types of values that managers should keep in mind and the process used by the Tech team at CD PROJEKT RED to find and refine their core values. Each of the five core values is presented along with examples of how they connect to the "real world". Finally, Colin and Marta outline what managers and HR must do in practice, and how they must work together, in order to implement and establish the values they have found.

在本次演讲中，Colin Walder 和 Marta Wozniak 描述了核心价值观在构建组织健康方面所起的作用，以及为什么管理者和高管必须重视这些价值观至关重要。当给予适当的关注时，它们可以成为将团队凝聚在一起的粘合剂，即使团队在不断壮大。而忽视并放任不管时，它们可能会导致团队分裂。Colin 和 Marta 描述了管理者应该牢记的不同类型的价值观，以及 CD PROJEKT RED 技术团队寻找和精炼其核心价值观的过程。每个核心价值观都进行了介绍，并举例说明了它们如何与“现实世界”相联系。最后，Colin 和 Marta 概述了管理者和人力资源部门在实践中必须做什么，以及他们必须如何合作，以实施和确立他们所发现的价值观。

## Three Mindset Shifts to Lead a World-Class Team

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/three-mindset-shifts-to-lead-a-world-class-team/906821

作者：Kristie Fisher  (Sr. Director of Global User Research, PlayStation Studios)

People are often put in charge of projects because they mastered a core discipline like art or game design, but leadership is its own skill. People are complicated, and when people are working in a group to do something highly complex and novel, like make a video game, the people-complication puzzle expands exponentially. Project and people leaders can often feel at a loss to understand why their team isn't collaborating effectively or why a project seems stuck in an endless churn loop. In this talk, I will provide three "mindset shifts" that I have seen work time and again at multiple companies to increase team velocity and drive collaborative creativity. These mindset shifts have been derived from my extensive personal experience, reading, and leadership training.

人们常常因为掌握了艺术或游戏设计等核心学科而被委以项目负责人的重任，但领导力本身也是一种技能。人在群体中工作，尤其是从事像制作视频游戏这样高度复杂且新颖的工作时，人员管理的复杂性会呈指数级增长。项目负责人和团队领导者经常会感到困惑，不明白为什么他们的团队不能有效地协作，或者为什么项目似乎陷入了无休止的反复修改循环。在本次演讲中，我将分享三种“思维模式转变”，这些转变我在多家公司中多次见证，它们能够提升团队的工作效率并促进协作创新。这些思维模式的转变来源于我个人的丰富经验、阅读以及领导力培训。

## Translating Between Business and Creativity as a Games Producer

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/translating-between-business-and-creativity-as-a-games-producer/907477

作者：John Lau  (Lead Producer, ustwo games)

A game producer's role is an ill-defined thing: Is it operational? Is it commercial? Is it creative? Is it organizational? Is it facilitation? Is it all of the above? Drawing on a 17-year career ranging from work-for-hire production, game design and indie games, Ustwo games Lead Producer John Lau sketches out a way of understanding the producer's role not just as an organizer, but as a translator between two uneasy allies: the creativity of a game team, and the logistical realities of the businesses that employ them.Talking through some hypothetical negotiations, he will finish by suggesting ways to set up key project tools so that a producer is better equipped to navigate those conversations.

游戏制作人的角色是一个界定不清的概念：它是运营性的吗？它是商业性的吗？它是创造性的吗？它是组织性的吗？它是协调性的吗？还是以上所有？基于长达17年的职业生涯，涵盖了外包制作、游戏设计和独立游戏开发，Ustwo Games的首席制作人John Lau描绘了一种理解制作人角色的方式，不仅将其视为组织者，还将其视为两个不安盟友之间的翻译者：游戏团队的创造力与雇佣他们的企业的后勤现实。通过讨论一些假设的谈判，他最后将提出一些设置关键项目工具的方法，以便使制作人更好地装备自己以应对这些对话。

## Turning Around a Playerbase in Crisis: A 'Destiny 2' Case Study

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/turning-around-a-playerbase-in-crisis-a-destiny-2-case-study/906996

作者：Alan Blaine  (Principal Designer, Bungie)

Even in the most successful live service game, there will inevitably be doldrums - player sentiment will be slowly dropping, or player population will be. These can usually be dealt with using one-off measures without harming the ongoing development of the next release(s). When both happen at the same time - you have a major problem that can kill your game if not dealt with swiftly! But you cannot derail development for the future either without jeopardizing your revenue streams. 


Destiny 2 has encountered this kind of crisis point a handful of times over the past 7 years and have developed a framework for addressing player concerns without disrupting the dev cycle - The Player Retention Strike Team. 


In this session, Alan Blaine (Principal Designer) walks the audience through lessons learned in one of these crises - how to know when you are approaching this kind of crisis, how to set up a strike team to deal with it, and the inner workings of that team itself.

即使是最成功的直播服务类游戏，也难免会遇到低谷期——玩家的情绪可能会逐渐下滑，或者玩家数量可能会减少。这些问题通常可以通过一次性措施来解决，而不会影响下一版本的持续开发。但当这两种情况同时发生时，你就会面临一个可能导致游戏失败的重大问题！然而，你也不能为了应对当前问题而偏离未来的开发轨道，否则会危及你的收入来源。

《命运2》在过去7年中曾多次遭遇这种危机，并且已经发展出一套框架来处理玩家关切而不干扰开发周期——即“玩家留存打击小组”。

在这次讲座中，艾伦·布莱恩（首席设计师）向观众介绍了他在其中一次危机中学到的经验——如何知道你正在接近这种危机，如何组建一个打击小组来应对它，以及该小组本身的运作机制。
