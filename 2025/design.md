作者：Takumi Yoshida  (Senior Game Programmer, Sony Interactive Entertainment)

This talk will explain the physics technology used in ASTRO BOT. In addition to traditional rigid body simulation, ASTRO BOT uses many advanced physics technologies that utilize the processing power of the PS5. For example, abundance of shiny gems in treasure cave, water flowing along the terrain, and balloons that deform with the weight of the player. Players can interact with these elements and feel delicate haptics feedback. Team ASOBI developed these gimmicks with the aim of creating toy-like interactions that are fun, pleasant, and satisfying just by touching them. This talk will provide implementation details for a large number of physics objects, fluids, soft bodies, cloth, and real-time destruction, as well as gameplay use cases and optimization techniques.

本次演讲将解释《ASTRO BOT》中使用的物理技术。除了传统的刚体模拟外，《ASTRO BOT》还使用了许多利用PS5处理能力的高级物理技术。例如，宝库洞穴中丰富的闪亮宝石、地形上的流水，以及因玩家重量而变形的气球。玩家可以与这些元素互动，并感受到细腻的触觉反馈。ASOBI团队开发了这些机关，旨在创造一种玩具般的互动体验，这种体验仅通过触摸就能带来乐趣、愉悦和满足感。本次演讲将详细介绍大量物理对象、流体、软体、布料以及实时破坏的实现细节，并分享游戏应用案例和优化技术。

## Avoiding the Historical Accuracy Trap: Lessons from Five Thousand Years of Fun

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/avoiding-the-historical-accuracy-trap-lessons-from-five-thousand-years-of-fun/907563

作者：Angus Mol  (Director, Leiden University Centre for Digital Humanities)、Aris Politopoulos  (Assistant Professor in Archaeology and Cultural Politics, Leiden University)

Aiming for historical accuracy in games is a trap: history's answer to 'what really happened', is at best a solid theory and at worst a deeply divisive ideological frame. Making games based on historical facts and accurate reconstructions of the past is costly and can generate destructive debates within both developer and player communities. 


This presentation by two 'play archaeologists' presents a different approach, knowledge-driven storytelling, rooted in studies of the past, particularly of how people played in and play with the past. The aim of the paper is to provide inspirational insights from the intersections past and present play to create more interesting, diverse, accessible, and inclusive experiences of the past in video games. This paper will combine knowledge about the past and its implementation in video games by focusing on the Royal Game of Ur, a 5000 year old board game, and the development of a video game based on it.

以历史准确性为目标在游戏开发中是一个陷阱：历史对于“究竟发生了什么”的回答，最好的情况是一种可靠的理论，而最坏的情况则是一种极具争议性的意识形态框架。基于历史事实和对过去的精确重建来制作游戏既昂贵又可能在开发者和玩家社区内引发破坏性的辩论。

由两位“游戏考古学家”呈现的不同方法是知识驱动的故事讲述，这种讲述方式根植于对过去的研究，特别是人们对过去如何玩耍和与之互动的研究。本文旨在从过去和现在的游戏交汇处提供启发性的见解，从而在电子游戏中创造更有趣、更多样化、更易访问且更具包容性的历史体验。本文将结合关于过去的知识及其在电子游戏中的应用，重点关注一款拥有5000年历史的棋盘游戏《皇家乌尔游戏》（Royal Game of Ur），并探讨以此为基础开发电子游戏的过程。

作者：Alexa Ray Corriea  (Senior Writer, Cliffhanger Games)

We have a tendency to think more academically – perhaps too clinically – about the craft of character creation when there are other extremely compelling places to look. What players want and how they connect to them has changed drastically in the last few years, and the stories we tell must keep up. This talk will turn the developer's gaze to the audience, and how they are speaking among themselves. Observing how fandoms consume stories can provide a pathway to new ways of thinking about centering players with character creation. This session will encourage writers and designers to consider fresh takes on traditional character development techniques that take into account modern audience sensibilities. The content draws from personal experience in interactive storytelling, analysis of popular games from the last few years and observational research of fandoms. Attendees will obtain a new understanding of fresh ways to approach developing characters.

我们往往倾向于从更学术的角度——也许过于临床地——看待角色创建的技艺，而忽略了其他同样引人入胜的视角。近年来，玩家的需求和他们与游戏角色的互动方式发生了巨大变化，我们讲述故事的方式也必须随之更新。这次演讲将把开发者们的目光转向受众，以及他们如何相互交流。观察粉丝群体如何消费故事可以为我们提供一条思考如何以现代观众的敏感度为中心化玩家角色创建的新途径。本节将鼓励编剧和设计师考虑对传统角色发展技巧进行新的、现代化的审视。内容基于个人在互动叙事方面的经验、对过去几年流行游戏的分析以及对粉丝群体的观察性研究。参与者将获得关于如何以新颖方式开发角色的新理解。

作者：Teng Shao  (Principle UX Designer, NetEase Games)

The challenge for any UGC platform is transforming players with no creation experience into content creators who can gradually progress and produce more high-quality content. Currently, "Eggy Party" boasts over 100 million player-created mini-game, and over 26 million creators with the youngest being only five years old. We believe our key to success lies in resolving a contradiction: ensuring that the UGC tools are simple and easy to understand for beginners while also meeting the needs of professional creators for rich features and editing efficiency. Through user experience design, we provide a suitable editing experience for creators of varying skillsets and stages.

任何UGC平台面临的挑战是将没有创作经验的玩家转变为能够逐步进步并产出更多高质量内容的内容创作者。目前，“Eggy Party”拥有超过一亿个玩家创建的小游戏，以及超过两千六百万的创作者，其中最年轻的只有五岁。我们相信我们的成功关键在于解决一个矛盾：确保UGC工具对初学者来说简单易懂，同时也能满足专业创作者对丰富功能和编辑效率的需求。通过用户体验设计，我们为不同技能水平和阶段的创作者提供了合适的编辑体验。

作者：Mark Schramm  (Director of Engineering, Creature)

Mixed Reality creates a fun backdrop for many experiences, but can this medium support narrative games? 


Starship Home is the first feature-length narrative MR game that not only plays out within the player's own four walls, but actively invites the player to take them to new worlds.


In this talk, industry veteran Mark Schramm, who has previously worked on titles such as SUPERHOT VR, explains how the audience can approach Mixed Reality to utilize its strengths and create compelling narrative experiences in an ever changing personal environment that oftentimes competes for the players attention. Learn about the various iterations the game has gone through and how they have evolved as the studio has gained a deeper understanding on blurring the lines between multiple realities.

混合现实为许多体验创造了有趣的背景，但这种媒介能否支持叙事游戏呢？

《星际飞船家园》是第一部时长达到故事片级别的叙事混合现实游戏，它不仅在玩家自己的四面墙内展开，还积极邀请玩家将自己带入新的世界。

在这次演讲中，行业资深人士马克·施拉姆（Mark Schramm），他曾参与过《SUPERHOT VR》等作品的开发，解释了观众如何利用混合现实的优势，在不断变化的个人环境中创造引人入胜的叙事体验，这些环境经常与玩家的注意力竞争。了解游戏经历了哪些不同的迭代过程，以及随着工作室对模糊多个现实界限的理解加深，这些迭代是如何演化的。

## Comedy and Games: The Why's, How's and Huhs?

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/comedy-and-games-the-whys-hows-and-huhs/907515

作者：Heather Woodward  (Writer, Respawn Entertainment)

Not all games are what you'd call "comedic". Sometimes "comedy" is considered a bad word when it comes to designing dramatic narratives. Sometimes we're just plain old scared to make a joke in case it doesn't get a laugh. But when used well, comedy can make any game feel richer and more lived in without being a distraction. In this talk, veteran comedian Heather Woodward will discuss why any game can benefit from comedy, how to use it within different game design teams, and how the heck to be funny, even if it doesn't come naturally to you.

并非所有游戏都可以称之为“喜剧”类游戏。有时在设计戏剧性叙事时，“喜剧”这个词可能会被认为是一个不好的选择。有时我们只是单纯地害怕开个玩笑却得不到笑声。但当运用得当时，喜剧可以使任何游戏感觉更加丰富和真实，而不会成为一种干扰。在这次演讲中，资深喜剧演员希瑟·伍德沃德将讨论为什么任何游戏都能从喜剧受益，如何在不同的游戏设计团队中运用它，以及即使对你来说幽默并不自然，如何做到风趣。

## Grid Topology vs Game Mechanics: Which Grid For You?

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/grid-topology-vs-game-mechanics-which-grid-for-you/907491

作者：Randy Smith  (Game Designer, Waves All Day)

Grids are supposed to make life easier for player and developer alike by quantizing space, but they also introduce questions that must be answered and problems that must be solved. They distort space in ways that can create confusion for your players and your game mechanics. They cause UI/UX friction when your camera, controls, and perspective are not in alignment. And they inform your art style and limit what types of spaces and interactions can be depicted easily and believably. This presentation lists these questions and problems and provides the rationale for their most common solutions.

网格旨在通过量化空间使玩家和开发者的生活更加轻松，但也引入了必须回答的问题和必须解决的问题。它们以可能导致玩家和游戏机制困惑的方式扭曲空间。当摄像机、控制方式和视角不一致时，它们会引起用户界面/用户体验的摩擦。并且，它们还影响艺术风格并限制了哪些类型的场景和互动可以容易且可信地展现。本演示列出了这些问题，并提供了这些常见问题解决方案的理由。

## How to Design and Build Production-Ready Game UI (Presented by Rive)

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/how-to-design-and-build-production-ready-game-ui-presented-by-rive/911175

作者：Guido Rosso  (Co-Founder and CEO, Rive)

In most game studios, designers create the UI and then hand it off to developers to make it functional. That handoff is often messy, time-consuming, and riddled with redundant work. Developers might struggle to execute the designer's vision due to their tool or language, or build functional UI with developer tools like HTML or XAML — not design tools. 


There is a new, better way to build game UI. With Rive, you design and animate game UI in the Rive Editor, export it to the Rive format, and run your files with the Rive Runtimes in Unity, Unreal, Defold, or your custom game engine.


Rive Co-founder and CEO Guido Rosso will break down how to build a game menu that's both functional and powerful, without sacrificing creativity. He'll also show examples from games using Rive today.

在大多数游戏工作室中，设计师创建用户界面（UI），然后将其移交给开发者使其具备功能性。这个交接过程通常杂乱无章、耗时且充满冗余工作。由于工具或编程语言的限制，开发者可能难以实现设计师的愿景，或者使用HTML或XAML等开发者工具构建功能性UI，而不是设计工具。

现在有一种更好的方式来构建游戏UI。通过Rive，您可以在Rive编辑器中设计和动画化游戏UI，导出为Rive格式，并在Unity、Unreal、Defold或您自定义的游戏引擎中使用Rive运行库运行这些文件。

Rive联合创始人兼首席执行官Guido Rosso将讲解如何构建既实用又强大的游戏菜单，同时不牺牲创意。他还将展示一些目前使用Rive的游戏示例。

## It's Gonna Hurt: Metagame Management in 'War Robots'

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/its-gonna-hurt-metagame-management-in-war-robots/907485

作者：Boris Burangulov  (Executive Producer (War Robots), MY.GAMES)

Genshin Impact, Destiny 2, AFK Journey, War Robots – what do these games have in common? They are all GaaS, designed for long-term play. To maintain engagement, they must regularly offer new content: heroes, weapons, robots, etc. However, developers eventually face the question: "Okay, we've already created 100 weapons in our game. Why would players need the 101st?"


At War Robots, we encountered this challenge in the fourth year. Now, eleven years into the game's life, we believe we have found the answer. And it may not please everyone: to maintain players' interest, sometimes you need to force them to engage with different content. For that you have to change the current meta. And this, unfortunately, is always gonna hurt.


We will explore different approaches to balancing content in GaaS, take a look at the analytical "toolbox" that we use for monitoring metagame, and share our best practices for changing it.

原神、命运2、AFK冒险之旅、战争机器人——这些游戏有什么共同点？它们都是游戏即服务（GaaS）模式，旨在为玩家提供长期的游戏体验。为了保持玩家的兴趣，他们必须定期提供新的内容：英雄、武器、机器人等。然而，开发者最终会面临一个问题：“好吧，我们的游戏中已经创建了100种武器。为什么玩家还需要第101种？”

在战争机器人这款游戏进入第四年时，我们也遇到了这个挑战。现在，这款游戏已经运营了十一年，我们认为我们找到了答案。而这个答案可能并不受所有人欢迎：为了维持玩家的兴趣，有时需要强制玩家接触不同的内容。为此，你需要改变当前的主流玩法（meta）。不幸的是，这总是会带来一定的伤害。

我们将探讨不同平衡GaaS内容的方法，看看我们用于监控游戏主流玩法的分析“工具箱”，并分享我们在改变主流玩法方面的最佳实践。

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/justifying-absurd-expenditures-on-fonts-and-other-silly-features/907230

作者：Joshua Sawyer  (Design Director, Obsidian Entertainment)

When is a feature "too much" given the scope of your game? When is a feature so "too much" that it wraps around to being incredible? Whether we're talking about custom fonts, rat swarms, or silly physics, sometimes you absolutely, positively need something that makes no sense whatsoever on paper. By looking at the custom fonts and unique text rendering features from 2022's Pentiment and similar moonshot features from other games, we'll explore the virtues of feature excess. You'll learn how to conceptualize ludicrous features, sell them to your team, and develop them without driving a freight train through your development budget.

什么时候一个功能对于你的游戏范围来说是“过多”的？什么时候一个功能如此“过多”以至于变得令人惊叹？无论是自定义字体、鼠群还是滑稽的物理效果，有时你绝对需要一些在纸面上完全说不通的东西。通过分析2022年《pentiment》中的自定义字体和独特的文本渲染功能，以及其他游戏中类似的大胆功能，我们将探讨功能过度使用的优点。你将学习如何构思荒诞的功能，向团队推销这些功能，并在不破坏你的开发预算的情况下进行开发。

作者：Lauryn Ash  (Narrative Director, Undead Labs)

In this session, Lauryn Ash (Narrative Director) explores the role of narrative design in game development, emphasizing its importance in bridging the gap between level design, narrative, and art. She will delve into defining the key concepts of Theme and Tone and reframe them as essential game design tools that align the team throughout the development process. We’ll explore the challenges of team dynamics, when disciplines say the same word but mean completely different things, walk through specific games (Far Cry 5, Star Child, and Fallout 4) to understand what and how theme and tone can help us all create engaging and cohesive level design.

在本环节中，Lauryn Ash（叙事总监）将探讨叙事设计在游戏开发中的作用，强调其在弥合关卡设计、叙事和艺术之间差距方面的重要性。她将深入定义主题和氛围这两个关键概念，并重新将其框架为在整个开发过程中对齐团队的重要游戏设计工具。我们将探索团队动态的挑战，当不同学科使用相同词汇却意味着完全不同的事情时，通过具体的游戏（《孤岛惊魂5》、《星之子》和《辐射4》）来了解主题和氛围如何帮助我们共同创造引人入胜且连贯的关卡设计。

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/level-design-summit-the-unusual-level-design-for-tactical-breach-wizards/910762

作者：Steve Lee  (Lead Level Designer, Half Mermaid)

This talk is about the unique level design process for the indie hit Tactical Breach Wizards - the ways in which the game's development was highly unusual, and things about the game and the approach to development that made making its 100+ levels unusually efficient, straightforward and fun. Steve will discuss some of the key design principles used to design the levels and the game's mechanics; how the entire campaign was designed, written and implemented in sequential order (which is usually a really bad idea), and everything he thinks helped make the game both a critical success, and a great project to work on.

本次演讲将介绍独立游戏《战术破魔巫师》独特的关卡设计过程——游戏开发过程中的一些非同寻常之处，以及使制作超过100个关卡变得异常高效、直接且有趣的游戏设计和开发方法。Steve将讨论用于设计关卡和游戏机制的一些关键设计原则；整个战役如何按照顺序进行设计、编写和实现（这通常是一个非常糟糕的做法），以及他认为哪些因素帮助这款游戏既获得了批评上的成功，也成为了一个很棒的工作项目。

## Making Collectibles Count

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/making-collectibles-count/907550

作者：Joe Morrissey  (Game Director, The Believer Company)

Collectibles: Feathers in Assassin's Creed, Pigeons in GTA, or Magazines in Mafia II - collectibles like these often bring derision among players and developers alike for being frustrating, lacking in rewards, or simply being nonsensical. Whereas the Sea Shanties in Black Flag, the Backpacks in Marvel's Spider-Man, and the Audio Diaries in Bioshock often bring praise for their world building, gameplay, and rewards. 


What is the DNA of a good collectible? How do you get your players to care about collecting? How can you evaluate your current collectibles to see if they are fun or fatiguing?


Joe Morrissey (Ghost of Tsushima, InFamous, City of Heroes, Death Jr.) has spent a career tempting you to search through worlds to find those hidden treasures. This talk outlines the key traits that go into a successful collectible, and how they can drive player agency and engagement.

收集物：《刺客信条》中的羽毛、《GTA》中的鸽子或《黑手党II》中的杂志——这类收集物经常让玩家和开发者感到沮丧，因为它们令人沮丧、缺乏奖励，或者仅仅是毫无意义。而《黑旗》中的海员歌曲、《蜘蛛侠》中的背包和《生化奇景》中的音频日记则因其世界构建、玩法和奖励而受到赞誉。

好的收集物的DNA是什么？如何让你的玩家关心收集？如何评估现有的收集物以查看它们是有趣的还是令人疲劳的？

乔·莫里塞（《对马岛之鬼》、《恶名昭彰》、《英雄城市》、《死亡jr.》）的职业生涯一直在引导你探索世界以寻找那些隐藏的宝藏。本次演讲概述了成功收集物的关键特征，以及它们如何推动玩家的自主性和参与度。

作者：Seth Rosen  (Game Director & Lead Designer, Ironwood Studios)

Pacific Drive is a game that defies description while managing to appeal to a broad audience. At its core, it's a survival-crafting game, but it’s also not, because survival-crafting games don't really exist. Sure, Pacific Drive has survival and crafting, but thanks to sound survival fundamentals and a focus on theme, setting, and player fantasy, it leaves many of the usual trappings of survival games in its dust.In this session, Seth Rosen (Game Director and Lead Designer) will lay out the fundamentals of survival gameplay he learned working on Don’t Starve and dive into how they were applied in designing Pacific Drive’s systems and structure. Through this dense and detailed look at what makes Pacific Drive tick, he will demonstrate how he avoided established formulas, look at how a taxonomy of survival experiences guided the design, and discuss the elements that step outside of traditional survival gameplay to offer a novel experience.

《太平洋驱动》是一款难以用语言形容，却能吸引广泛玩家的游戏。从核心来看，它是一款生存建造类游戏，但又不完全是，因为真正的生存建造类游戏并不存在。当然，《太平洋驱动》包含了生存和建造元素，但由于其坚实的声音生存基础以及对主题、背景和玩家幻想的关注，它超越了许多传统生存游戏的常见套路。在这次分享中，塞斯·罗森（游戏总监兼首席设计师）将介绍他在开发《饥荒》时学到的生存游戏设计基础知识，并深入探讨这些知识如何应用于《太平洋驱动》系统的构建和结构设计。通过这种密集且详细的分析，他将展示如何避免已有的固定模式，探讨了一种生存体验分类法如何指导设计过程，并讨论了那些跳出传统生存游戏玩法的元素，从而提供一种新颖的游戏体验。

## 'Prince of Persia:The Lost Crown': Making a Modern Metroidvania Both Challenging and Accessible

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/prince-of-persiathe-lost-crown-making-a-modern-metroidvania-both-challenging-and-accessible/907388

作者：Remi Boutin  (Senior Game Designer, Ubisoft)

During the prototyping of 'Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown,' one genre became evident when modernizing the gameplay: the metroidvania. However, this type of game is not known for being the most accessible. The team aimed to create a challenging game while opening it to as many players as possible. The question of accessibility and its impact on difficulty arose early on, but there were a lot of challenges for the team, which was smaller than a usual AAA production. 

In this talk, Rémi Boutin presents the philosophy and solutions used to achieve the team's vision. He will detail how accessibility can be a strength for discovering innovative core concepts, how to provide a challenging game with a deep combat system while making it accessible, and how to plan and develop accessibility without a dedicated team.

在“波斯王子：失落之冠”原型开发过程中，当现代元素融入 gameplay 时，一个显而易见的游戏类型浮现出来：类银河恶魔城。然而，这类游戏并不以高可玩性著称。团队的目标是创造一款具有挑战性的游戏，同时尽可能让更多玩家能够接触。关于可访问性和其对难度的影响的问题很早就提出来了，但对这个规模小于 typical AAA production 的小团队来说，存在许多挑战。

在这次演讲中，Rémi Boutin 将介绍团队实现愿景所采用的理念和解决方案。他将详细说明可访问性如何成为探索创新核心概念的优势，如何提供一个具有深度战斗系统的具有挑战性的游戏，并使其易于上手，以及如何在没有专门团队的情况下规划和开发可访问性。

作者：Ira Fay  (Learning Game Designer, MIT)、Cody Miller  (CEO, Far Off Games)

In this talk, Cody and Ira share best practices and pitfalls of their 10-year design and development process of Arydia: The Paths We Dare Tread, including a successful crowdfunding campaign (~$1.4MM and ~10,500 backers). Arydia is an open world, campaign-based, co-operative, fantasy-themed role-playing board game. We strive to maximize Arydia's audience and differentiate it from other games on the market via increased traditional role playing opportunities and fully prepainted miniatures (with interchangeable heads!) included in every copy of the game. Cody, as designer, and Ira, as developer, discuss their roles on the project and the biggest challenges they faced (e.g. what to do when the first manufacturing plan far exceeds the desired budget). They conclude by sharing the "secret sauce" of their successful, multi-year collaboration, outlined in five clear points that any small team can replicate.

在这次演讲中，Cody和Ira分享了他们在开发Arydia: The Paths We Dare Tread（Arydia：我们敢于行走的道路）这10年设计和开发过程中的最佳实践和常见陷阱，包括一次成功的众筹活动（约140万美元和约10,500名支持者）。Arydia是一款开放世界、基于战役、合作型的幻想主题角色扮演游戏。他们致力于通过增加传统角色扮演机会以及每份游戏中包含的完全预涂装的迷你模型（可互换头部！）来最大化Arydia的受众并将其与市场上的其他游戏区分开来。Cody作为设计师，Ira作为开发者，讨论了他们在项目中的角色以及面临的最大挑战（例如，当第一个生产计划远远超出预期预算时该怎么办）。他们最后分享了他们成功多年合作的“秘诀”，总结为五点清晰的要点，任何小团队都可以复制。

作者：Emma Larkins  (Board Game Designer, Independent)

As board game designers, publishers, retailers, and players, we don't always have teachability and learnability of games at the forefront of our minds. We see a shiny new idea or game and are excited to engage with it! Our expectations of a smooth onboarding experience are often frustrated, at best creating a barrier to playing the game and at worst ensuring that the game doesn't get played at all. Know that teaching and learning board games is not a "you" problem but an industry-wide issue. Luckily, people across the board game sphere are dedicated to innovating in this space, with lots of exciting tools and techniques slowly being experimented with and adopted.

作为棋盘游戏设计师、出版商、零售商和玩家，我们并不总是将游戏的教学性和可学习性放在首位。我们看到一个闪亮的新想法或游戏时就会兴奋地想要参与！我们对顺畅入门体验的期望往往会被挫败，这最多只会成为玩游戏的一个障碍，最坏的情况下则会导致游戏根本无法进行。要知道，教学和学习棋盘游戏不是“你”的问题，而是整个行业的问题。幸运的是，棋盘游戏领域的各界人士都在致力于在这个领域进行创新，许多令人兴奋的工具和技术正在被逐步试验和采纳。

作者：Cole Wehrle  (Creative Director, Leder Games, Wehrlegig Games)、Josh Yearsley  (Editor and Game Developer, Leder Games)

Over the past decade, Leder Games has been developing a new "early access" approach to tabletop game design. This method has built some of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful games in the hobby tabletop market. In this presentation, creative director Cole Wehrle and editor and game developer Josh Yearsley talk about the studio's history with this approach and how it transformed the games we make. We'll start with a general overview of the unique role of crowdfunding in tabletop and how it built on and professionalized a tradition of community-driven design work. We'll briefly cover the creation of Root and its expansions, then discuss how we scaled up those processes during the development of Oath and how we put these methods to the test with our most ambitious project yet, the newly released science fiction game Arcs.

## Teaching First-Time Level Designers for 'Infinity Nikki'

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/teaching-first-time-level-designers-for-infinity-nikki/911449

作者：Kentaro Tominaga  (Sub-Director, Infold Games)

Level design is often viewed as expensive handicraft. For young developers looking for a career in level design, it can be a long, lonely journey. Infold Games originated as a mobile dress-up and romance simulation studio, and had never worked on 3D platformer or openworld games before 'Infinity Nikki'. Within 5 years, the team scaled to near 1,000 at launch. Most designers are young, passionate first-timers and much of its in-game design came from continuous bottom-up inspirations.This talk will share the 3 layers of developer coaching that Kentaro Tominaga implemented at Infold Games and iterated day-to-day: translate, communicate, debate. In light of his methodology, he will present cases behind real-life design decisions.On the surface, these practices may appear basic, can sometimes slow development and are seemingly expensive. However, its application on the 'Infinity Nikki' team has shown to be effective for the training and growth of young designers, underscoring that investment in team coaching is always worth it.

关卡设计通常被视为昂贵的手工艺。对于寻求在关卡设计领域发展的年轻开发者来说，这可能是一条漫长而孤独的道路。Infold Games 最初是一个移动换装和浪漫模拟工作室，在《Infinity Nikki》之前从未涉足过3D平台或开放世界游戏。在不到五年的时间里，团队规模扩大到接近1000人。大多数设计师都是充满激情的新人，许多游戏内的设计灵感来自于持续不断的自下而上的创新。本次演讲将分享Kentaro Tominaga在Infold Games实施并每日迭代的开发者指导三层方法：翻译、沟通、辩论。基于他的方法论，他将展示一些真实设计决策背后的原因。表面上看，这些做法可能显得基础，有时甚至会减缓开发进程，并且似乎成本高昂。然而，在《Infinity Nikki》团队中的应用表明，这对年轻设计师的培训和成长非常有效，强调了对团队指导的投资总是值得的。

## The Game Maker's Zodiac: A Team-Building Tool

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/the-game-makers-zodiac-a-team-building-tool/907262

作者：Isaque Sanches  (Senior Game Designer, Ubisoft)

Folks in the games industry want to make games for many reasons: not everyone is motivated by the same things.


This lecture takes a look at different types of creators in the industry: not only by job family (code, design, art, audio, production, etc) but by grouping them by personality traits, backgrounds, aesthetic preferences and biases.


From there, a general high-level breakdown is presented: the lecturer proposes 13 archetypes for videogame creators, based on research (cross-referencing literature and collected data), and invites you to explore how these might communicate with one another, what are the strengths and weaknesses of each archetype grouping, and how they can all work in harmony by co-empowering each other.

游戏行业中的从业者想要制作游戏的原因各不相同：并不是每个人都被同样的东西所激励。

本次讲座着眼于行业内不同类型的创作者：不仅按职业类别（编程、设计、美术、音频、制作等）划分，还通过个性特征、背景、审美偏好和偏见来分组。

在此基础上，讲座提出了一个大致的高层次分类：讲师基于研究（交叉引用文献和收集的数据）提出了13种电子游戏创作者的原型，并邀请您探索这些原型之间可能如何交流，每种原型组合的优势和劣势是什么，以及他们如何通过互相赋能实现和谐共处。

## UX Summit: Mind Over Mechanics: Using Cognitive Science to Enhance Game Development

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/ux-summit-mind-over-mechanics-using-cognitive-science-to-enhance-game-development/908478

作者：Vanessa Hemovich  (Professor of Psychology, Digipen Institute of Technology)

Understanding the science behind player spatial coding systems offers valuable insights for game designers and developers. Research in cognitive science demonstrates how users navigate virtual environments through use of spatial iconicity principles, mental rotation, processing cognitive dsyfluency, and mental mapping schemas. These embodied sybolic representations significantly impact user interaction with game worlds but if not understood can quickly overpower player processing speeds and generate heavy cognitive load - which, in turn, negatively impacts satisfaction and overall experiences.This presentation will explore how incorporating spatial coding schemas into game design can lead to more sophisticated design choices by building on well-established concepts in psychological and cognitive science. Attendees will be provided a variety of practical methods and design choices by evaluating and applying their own cognitive spatial coding systems to better understand visuo-auditory capacities of the human brain. By leveraging insights into cognitive concepts, industry professionals can learn how players perceive and engage with game environments by creating more intuitive and immersive gameplay experiences.

理解玩家空间编码系统背后的科学为游戏设计师和开发者提供了宝贵的见解。认知科学研究表明，用户如何通过使用空间象征性原则、心理旋转、处理认知不流畅以及心理映射方案来导航虚拟环境。这些具身符号表征显著影响用户与游戏世界的互动，但如果缺乏理解，则可能会迅速超越玩家的处理速度并产生沉重的认知负荷——这反过来又会负面影响满意度和整体体验。本演示将探讨如何将空间编码方案融入游戏设计，从而通过利用心理学和认知科学中已建立的概念，做出更复杂的设计选择。与会者将通过评估和应用他们自己的认知空间编码系统，获得多种实用方法和设计选择，以更好地理解人类大脑的视知觉和听觉能力。通过利用对认知概念的洞察，行业专业人士可以学习如何通过创建更具直觉性和沉浸感的游戏玩法体验，使玩家感知和参与游戏环境。

## UX Summit: VR Is for Everyone: Designing Comfortable Virtual Reality

链接：https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/ux-summit-vr-is-for-everyone-designing-comfortable-virtual-reality/909682

作者：Tabby Rose  (UX Director, Mighty Yell Studios)

Virtual reality games, especially when working with a limited budget or team size, are more greatly impacted by barriers to play than regular games. Simply playing a VR game is hindered by a lot of factors: wearing a headset, needing to physically move around, or feeling motion sick. Although players often express this as discomfort, in reality these are accessibility issues, and addressing low mobility, vision loss, hearing loss, and attentional difficulty provides a better experience for every player. This presentation will explore a range of barriers to play that are unique to VR and how they were addressed for the VR title A Knight in the Attic.

虚拟现实游戏，尤其是当预算有限或团队规模较小的情况下，比普通游戏更容易受到游玩障碍的影响。仅仅去玩一款VR游戏就受到了许多因素的阻碍：佩戴头显、需要物理移动，或者感到晕动症。尽管玩家常常将其描述为不适，但实际上这些都是可访问性问题。解决低mobility（行动能力低下）、视力下降、听力下降和注意力困难等问题，能够为每一位玩家提供更好的体验。本演示将探讨一些仅存在于VR中的游玩障碍，以及它们是如何在VR游戏《阁楼里的骑士》中得到解决的。
